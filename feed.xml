<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We are continuing our <em>Typography Jargon Buster</em> series! This time, we go over type detail terms describing constructions of letters. These visual elements make fonts different from each other to communicate different meanings. </span></p>

<h1> </h1>
<h1><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ascender</span><a id="Ascender"></a></h1>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">An ascender is a vertical stroke of a lowercase letter extending upwards, beyond the x-height, sometimes beyond the cap height. For example, “h” is a lowercase letter with an ascender. In general, typefaces having long ascenders and descenders help with readability. Long ascenders help make a lowercase more distinguishable as long as the other parts of the letters are legible.</span></p>
<figure class="post__image"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://typogram.co/blog/media/posts/40/ascender-3.png" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" srcset="https://typogram.co/blog/media/posts/40/responsive/ascender-3-xs.png 300w ,https://typogram.co/blog/media/posts/40/responsive/ascender-3-sm.png 480w ,https://typogram.co/blog/media/posts/40/responsive/ascender-3-md.png 768w ,https://typogram.co/blog/media/posts/40/responsive/ascender-3-lg.png 1024w"  alt="Ascender" width="1200" height="630"></figure>
<h1> </h1>
<h1><span style="font-weight: 400;">Baseline</span><a id="Baseline"></a></h1>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The baseline is the horizon line (sometimes invisible) on which the letters sit. In most typefaces, curved letters, like “O,” “e,” and “s,” sit slightly below the baseline to create optical balance and alignment with other letters. Letters with descenders like “p” and “q” extend below the baseline.</span></p>
<figure class="post__image"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://typogram.co/blog/media/posts/40/baseline-3.png" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" srcset="https://typogram.co/blog/media/posts/40/responsive/baseline-3-xs.png 300w ,https://typogram.co/blog/media/posts/40/responsive/baseline-3-sm.png 480w ,https://typogram.co/blog/media/posts/40/responsive/baseline-3-md.png 768w ,https://typogram.co/blog/media/posts/40/responsive/baseline-3-lg.png 1024w"  alt="Baseline" width="1200" height="630"></figure>
<h1> </h1>
<h1><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bracket</span><a id="Bracket"></a></h1>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A bracket is a curved or wedge-like area connecting a serif and a stroke. This curve area can be large or small. Typefaces with large areas of curves are said to have large bracketing. Those with small curved areas have small bracketing. Some serif typefaces have no bracketing. </span></p>
<figure class="post__image"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://typogram.co/blog/media/posts/40/bracket-2.png" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" srcset="https://typogram.co/blog/media/posts/40/responsive/bracket-2-xs.png 300w ,https://typogram.co/blog/media/posts/40/responsive/bracket-2-sm.png 480w ,https://typogram.co/blog/media/posts/40/responsive/bracket-2-md.png 768w ,https://typogram.co/blog/media/posts/40/responsive/bracket-2-lg.png 1024w"  alt="Bracket" width="1200" height="630"></figure>
<h1> </h1>
<h1><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cap Height</span><a id="CapHeight"></a></h1>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cap Height is the height of a capital letter, measured from the baseline to flat capitals like “H.” Letters like “S” and “O,” have a slight overshoot over the cap height. This is done so that curve-topped letters like “S” or “O” look optically aligned and balanced with flat-topped letters like “H.”</span></p>
<figure class="post__image"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://typogram.co/blog/media/posts/40/cap-height-3.png" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" srcset="https://typogram.co/blog/media/posts/40/responsive/cap-height-3-xs.png 300w ,https://typogram.co/blog/media/posts/40/responsive/cap-height-3-sm.png 480w ,https://typogram.co/blog/media/posts/40/responsive/cap-height-3-md.png 768w ,https://typogram.co/blog/media/posts/40/responsive/cap-height-3-lg.png 1024w"  alt="Cap Height" width="1200" height="630"></figure>
<h1> </h1>
<h1><span style="font-weight: 400;">Counter</span><a id="Counter"></a></h1>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A counter is an unfilled (white or negative) space partially or entirely closed by other parts of the letters. For example, lowercase “b” and uppercase “U” both have counters. The stroke creating a counter shape is known as a “bowl.” There are two types of counter spaces: open and closed. An <strong>open counter</strong> means the unfilled space is partially closed, like “U.” A <strong>closed counter</strong> happens when the unfilled space is completely sealed, like “b.” </span></p>
<figure class="post__image"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://typogram.co/blog/media/posts/40/counter.png" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" srcset="https://typogram.co/blog/media/posts/40/responsive/counter-xs.png 300w ,https://typogram.co/blog/media/posts/40/responsive/counter-sm.png 480w ,https://typogram.co/blog/media/posts/40/responsive/counter-md.png 768w ,https://typogram.co/blog/media/posts/40/responsive/counter-lg.png 1024w"  alt="Counter" width="1200" height="630"></figure>
<h1> </h1>
<h1><span style="font-weight: 400;">Descender</span><a id="Descender"></a></h1>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A descender is a vertical stroke of a lowercase letter extending below the baseline. For example, “p” is a lowercase letter with a descender. Like ascenders, long descenders make lowercase letters more distinguishable, improving readability.  </span></p>
<figure class="post__image"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://typogram.co/blog/media/posts/40/descender-2.png" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" srcset="https://typogram.co/blog/media/posts/40/responsive/descender-2-xs.png 300w ,https://typogram.co/blog/media/posts/40/responsive/descender-2-sm.png 480w ,https://typogram.co/blog/media/posts/40/responsive/descender-2-md.png 768w ,https://typogram.co/blog/media/posts/40/responsive/descender-2-lg.png 1024w"  alt="Descender" width="1200" height="630"></figure>
<h1> </h1>
<h1><span style="font-weight: 400;">Terminal</span><a id="Terminal"></a></h1>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A Terminal is an end of a straight or curved stroke without serifs. The terminal can be a place where a typeface showcases its stylistic elements. For example, in some letters, like “a,” there can be a droplet shape at the end of a stroke. This is called a ball terminal. </span></p>
<figure class="post__image"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://typogram.co/blog/media/posts/40/ball-terminal.png" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" srcset="https://typogram.co/blog/media/posts/40/responsive/ball-terminal-xs.png 300w ,https://typogram.co/blog/media/posts/40/responsive/ball-terminal-sm.png 480w ,https://typogram.co/blog/media/posts/40/responsive/ball-terminal-md.png 768w ,https://typogram.co/blog/media/posts/40/responsive/ball-terminal-lg.png 1024w"  alt="Terminal" width="1200" height="630"></figure>
<h1> </h1>
<h1><span style="font-weight: 400;">x-Height</span><a id="x-Height"></a></h1>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The term x-height describes the distance from the baseline to the top of a flat-topped lowercase letter, like the lowercase “x.” x-height is a stylistic choice and varies for different typefaces. However, x-height also is a factor in readability. As the x-height increase, the length of ascenders and descenders usually decreases. This causes the letters to become less readable.</span></p>
<figure class="post__image"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://typogram.co/blog/media/posts/40/x-height-2.png" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" srcset="https://typogram.co/blog/media/posts/40/responsive/x-height-2-xs.png 300w ,https://typogram.co/blog/media/posts/40/responsive/x-height-2-sm.png 480w ,https://typogram.co/blog/media/posts/40/responsive/x-height-2-md.png 768w ,https://typogram.co/blog/media/posts/40/responsive/x-height-2-lg.png 1024w"  alt="x-Height" width="1200" height="630"></figure>
<figure class="post__image"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://typogram.co/blog/media/posts/40/typedetails.png" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" srcset="https://typogram.co/blog/media/posts/40/responsive/typedetails-xs.png 300w ,https://typogram.co/blog/media/posts/40/responsive/typedetails-sm.png 480w ,https://typogram.co/blog/media/posts/40/responsive/typedetails-md.png 768w ,https://typogram.co/blog/media/posts/40/responsive/typedetails-lg.png 1024w"  alt="type details" width="1680" height="630"></figure>

<h1 id="create-account--redeem-license">Create Account &amp; Redeem License</h1>
<p>You can start designing your brand by logging into the app and creating your branding project. You can redeem your license with your license redemption code. Here are the steps:</p>
<ul>
<li>Go to <a href="https://typogram.co/account">https://typogram.co/account</a> and sign in</li>
<li>Type in your brand name and click on “Add” to create your branding project</li>
<li>Click on “Upgrade License” on the project that you want to upgrade</li>

<blockquote>How is Typogram development going?</blockquote>

<p>We have been busy building our favorite logo design tool. Here is what we have been working for the last month. (Missed the previous updates? See our <a href="https://typogram.co/blog/typogram-product-updates-no6/">previous update</a> and our archive <a href="https://typogram.co/blog/tags/inside-typogram/">here</a>)</p>
<hr>
<h1 id="a-preview-of-whats-to-come">A Preview of What’s to Come</h1>
<p>We are inching close to our launch. We are putting on the final touches and will have everything ready by the end of this month. Below is a walkthrough of our app and what’s to come.</p>
<h2 id="add-project-and-redeem-license-code">Add Project and Redeem License Code</h2>
<p>Thanks for being our earliest supporters! When you log in to the app, you’ll be able to create branding projects and redeem your license with your license code(s). Your license redemption code was sent to your purchasing email address when you pre-ordered. If you cannot find your code, please email Hua at <a href="mailto:&#104;&#x75;&#97;&#64;&#116;&#121;&#112;&#x6f;&#x67;&#x72;&#97;&#x6d;&#46;&#99;&#x6f;">&#104;&#x75;&#97;&#64;&#116;&#121;&#112;&#x6f;&#x67;&#x72;&#97;&#x6d;&#46;&#99;&#x6f;</a>, and she will locate and send you your code.</p>
<p><figure class="post__image"><img loading="lazy" src="https://typogram.co/blog/media/posts/37/1.-Add-Project-and-Redeem-License-Code.gif" alt="Add Project and Redeem License Code" width="1440" height="900" /></figure></p>
<figcaption align = "center">Add project and redeem license code</figcaption>

<h2 id="open-project-and-select-brand-personalities">Open Project and Select Brand Personalities</h2>
<p>Click anywhere on the project card to open the project, and start your branding process by selecting brand personalities:</p>
<p><figure class="post__image"><img loading="lazy" src="https://typogram.co/blog/media/posts/37/2.-Open-Project-and-Select-Brand-Personalities.gif" alt="Open project and select brand personalities" width="1440" height="900" /></figure></p>
<figcaption align = "center">Open project and select brand personalities</figcaption>

<h2 id="select-brand-color-and-logo-typefaces">Select Brand Color And Logo Typefaces</h2>
<p>Select brand color and logo typefaces easily. We included color tips and curated logo typefaces to help you make your selections when you design. You can find more details of brand color features on our <a href="https://typogram.co/blog/typogram-product-update-no5/">Typogram Product Update, No.5</a>.</p>
<p><figure class="post__image"><img loading="lazy" src="https://typogram.co/blog/media/posts/37/3.-Select-Brand-Colors.gif" alt="Select brand color and logo typefaces" width="1440" height="900" /></figure></p>
<figcaption align = "center">Select brand color and logo typefaces</figcaption>

<h2 id="select-logo-typefaces">Select Logo Typefaces</h2>
<p>Informed by your chosen brand personality, we have curated a list of typefaces that fits your brands. You can also turn on additional brand personality to broaden your choices.</p>
<p><figure class="post__image"><img loading="lazy" src="https://typogram.co/blog/media/posts/37/4.-Select-Logo-Typefaces.gif" alt="Select logo typefaces" width="1440" height="900" /></figure></p>
<figcaption align = "center">Select logo typefaces</figcaption>

<h2 id="design-logo">Design Logo</h2>
<p>Once you have selected your brand color and logo typeface, you can access your chosen color in the color palette and start designing your logo. The “kerning” feature also helps you fine-tune the space between letters to create more polished designs. We went through a simple design case here to save time, but logo editing has many more features. You can find more details about them in <a href="https://typogram.co/blog/typogram-product-update-june-2022/">Typogram Product Update, No.1</a>.</p>
<p><figure class="post__image"><img loading="lazy" src="https://typogram.co/blog/media/posts/37/5.-Design-Logo.gif" alt="Design logo" width="1440" height="900" /></figure></p>
<figcaption align = "center">Design logo</figcaption>

<h2 id="select-typography-systems-and-publish-guidelines">Select Typography Systems and Publish Guidelines</h2>
<p>After designing the logo, you can select your Typography System for marketing and create a sharable brand guideline. As we shared <a href="https://typogram.co/blog/typogram-product-updates-no6/">previously</a>, we have completely revamped the band guideline, including features like additional shades and incorrect logo usage examples.</p>
<p><figure class="post__image"><img loading="lazy" src="https://typogram.co/blog/media/posts/37/6-small.-Select-Typography-Systems-and-Publish-Guidelines.gif" alt="Select typography systems and publish guidelines" width="1440" height="900" /></figure></p>
<figcaption align = "center">Select typography systems and publish guidelines</figcaption>

<p>And that’s it! We’ll be sending out a launch announcement in a couple of weeks! We are nervous and excited and can’t wait to hear your feedback. </p>

<p>How is Typogram development going?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We have been busy building our favorite logo design tool. Here are the features we have been working for November. (Missed the previous updates? See <a href="https://typogram.co/blog/typogram-product-update-no5/">October</a> and our archive <a href="https://typogram.co/blog/tags/inside-typogram/">here</a>)</p>

<h1 id="brand-guidelines-revamp">Brand Guidelines Revamp</h1>
<p>One of our most important features is the brand guidelines, a useful reference page serving as a library for creative assets, and a shareable formula sheet for your brand. It is one of the earliest features we built and one of the last features to revisit in preparation for our launch in January 2023. You can check out <a href="https://typogram.co/app/brand-guidelines?brand=Toms+Frozen+Pet+Treats">a</a> <a href="https://typogram.co/app/brand-guidelines?brand=Accelerate+Yale">few</a> <a href="https://typogram.co/app/brand-guidelines?brand=DreamKit">examples</a> of our previous brand guidelines on our <a href="https://typogram.co/">home page</a>, under the Testimonials section. In the last few weeks, we completely revamped the brand guideline page.</p>
<p>We collected feedback from our pre-order customers and created this new design — a more dynamic layout with more breathing room. We also improved functionalities — making publishing a brand guidelines page more streamlined.</p>
<h2 id="preview-brand-guidelines">Preview Brand Guidelines</h2>
<p>After the last step — choosing the typography system, we can preview the brand guidelines on the same page before it is officially published. Our chosen brand typography and colors are directly reflected on the guidelines page: the heading, paragraph, and even the download button label styles on the guidelines page are coherent with your brand’s typography system, the color of the page background, text, and border are also using the grayscale colors from your brand color palettes.</p>
<p><figure class="post__image"><img loading="lazy" src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/zrcRuw9-uQ_65jbESXuWP9iGOuKMYgCv3pbO5_VT0wbNRHJ9H4phqzU6VisnEihpH19sczqgxlq9P0FGDjJP6uln3YYxlsdcY1i4n6Laxex5sbzJLCrSBJn8Vv42VbKUbcHh7J71lPy9gmrdedZ4WS0MzRUi4K_WTXvO9fwVWBFUOywgEv-avNZaxk7qOw" data-is-external-image="true"  alt="Preview Brand Guidelines" /></figure></p>
<figcaption align = "center">Your previous design choices applied to the brand guidelines page, such as the title typeface</figcaption>

<h2 id="publish-brand-guidelines">Publish Brand Guidelines</h2>
<p>After making sure everything looks good to go, we can click on Publish Brand Guidelines button to finish off our Typogram journey. A new public page is created and opened in a new tab, which is used for sharing.</p>
<p><figure class="post__image"><img loading="lazy" src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/o8zsrGrh_idC2bja8K5-PBzD60AeNmHeENMZKiV8L8jypiFEHzOUSha2W9hOyJLX3jBNK_q5b28lIvHoff3ICv5NyQwNy8kHGpOe69YF9RkWuVELYYGZGlNavpPf9mqK-uS-zvvDX1I8KKAFgyCfL8zQPS9zgJn9ry02kn0wox6Rr0Xd_4jZESFkLrLUsA" data-is-external-image="true"  alt="Publish Brand Guidelines" /></figure></p>
<figcaption align = "center">Preview and then hit “Publish” — the public brand guidelines is opened in a new tab upon publishing</figcaption>

<h2 id="introducing-typogram-brand-guidelines">Introducing Typogram Brand Guidelines</h2>
<p>And finally, here is an ultra-fast tour of the brand-new, completely revamped Brand Guidelines page. It has four sections: Overview, Logo, Colors, and Typography. One detail to point out is that we added a lot of logo misuse examples to make sure whoever needs to use your logo will not mistreat the logo graphically once given this brand guideline:</p>

<h1 id="choosing-brand-colors">Choosing Brand Colors</h1>
<p>This month, we focused on a critical feature: Brand Colors. From chatting with our customers, we know many struggles with brand colors, so we focused on making this feature as visual and accessible as possible.</p>
<p>There are several things we have created in this feature to help you choose colors:</p>
<ul>
<li>Preview Primary Brand Color in Graphics</li>
<li>Grayscale Colors</li>
<li>Accent Colors</li>
<li>View Color Tips</li>
<li>Hex Input and More</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h2 id="detail-1-preview-primary-brand-color-in-graphics">Detail 1: Preview Primary Brand Color in Graphics</h2>
<p>A common misconception is that color value is absolute and can stand on its own. While it is true mathematically, it is false optically. Our eyes absolutely do fool us at times — a red color can look 100% blue once put next to a set of certain colors and shades. It is essential to build a color palette for your brand instead of a singular color. With Typogram, you can preview the primary brand color palettes in a graphic in real time as you are making changes.</p>
<p><figure class="post__image"><img loading="lazy" src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/vEFH-HQhistnsmasPrhvAHCiwnUK2FcAfZKg7L5A3IDz6DfsO8pmU5K89XdK0DLTcmLD6_OzP1pl66PoJG1QDWNFJPmRkGhV7FK1OGDCPZBz7xDgtQvfuQQOSO3BYHju2B_1KKqeBGfNn4cunbTMGAy2B8He1Ui_c4rUJCKP5XWC2JWn1I3fU7-JMg" data-is-external-image="true"  alt="Preview Primary Brand Color in Graphics" /></figure></p>
<figcaption align = "center"> Preview Primary Brand Color in Graphics</figcaption>



<hr>
<h2 id="detail-2-grayscale-colors">Detail 2: Grayscale Colors</h2>
<p>A common pitfall of branding is over-using brand color everywhere. A booklet full of bright blue text is not a good idea — when used excessively, the brand color disappears instead of standing out. Brand colors are meant to be used somewhat scarcely and stand out amid more neutral tones — that is where the grayscale color palette comes in. Grayscale colors have very low saturation, which you can adjust between 0% to 16%. It is also a good idea to make the “neutral” gray not entirely neutral. Inject the hue of the primary brand color into the grayscale colors to hint at your brand color subtly. Even when your logo is not present, users can still feel your brand’s presence because the dark gray text radiates your brand color in small doses. </p>
<p><figure class="post__image"><img loading="lazy" src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/BDPFzagU7D6wc6y4jEylltPFqKYglkXhRzmDkj5iF9D-_7LUeOwoG771ukxSn8PDDJLauIXDFk_qKj0aACdfbiqn255PLgS9U-v5wCMGUkS_nY43k2EENpK4NrqHrBEsa0MJI5TEDxBdBh5i7DqdBL8fC1xrG2VbSsQJe_Mt7SeDPX05h1MHXYnzHA" data-is-external-image="true"  alt="gif: Grayscale Colors" /></figure></p>
<figcaption align = "center">Grayscale Colors</figcaption>

<hr>
<h2 id="detail-3-accent-colors">Detail 3: Accent Colors</h2>
<p>Unlike grayscale colors, which are a must-have, accent colors are optional and up to you to decide. Similar to grayscale colors’ “binding” to the primary brand color in hue values, accent colors bind with the primary color in saturation values to create harmony.</p>
<p><figure class="post__image"><img loading="lazy" src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/E96ovZ-sXL0hNS8ju4dgFXt0_vwS-9mVGMkvmN_sjt1F11lNDdsF_swmP-s8dSRIkQUtsEK5SQFrIWcE7OhW89s_mrw0ZGO_tIzH6Ju9oACKWjfysIcVrBeASfBcvnBSt_DFu00lGJnZjXVAognOZZdq_dapHBfEdrtWm7Mmajgc8UhAKFsG8iKY6Q" data-is-external-image="true"  alt="Accent Colors" /></figure></p>
<figcaption align = "center">Accent Colors</figcaption>

<hr>
<h2 id="detail-4-view-color-tips">Detail 4: View Color Tips</h2>
<p>Choosing brand colors is not an instinct thing. Instinct will draw me to colors that appeal to me personally, but my favorite color will not be the most suitable for my company and its audience. We should ditch our instinct for a little bit and choose values in hue, saturation, and lightness, respectively, based on rationales. “View Tips” provide rationales to you in real-time while you drag the values up and down. What does hue 19 mean in brand color psychology? The tips section gives a direct, timely answer to help you decide.</p>
<p><figure class="post__image"><img loading="lazy" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/ZVbRB_C14nkZUz4jWTWY5_q7tuktr6jbWqNYc-wIqbv8WnEOAuoO3KD2mtUcc-GDO36kXMIUEgHF5HVXomjj3_pDQdvCcyHiLxyego8tdH-6vEvqR0YGft9ivVglXEDfxdNz0gW_yFv1nqt08qLStVJSN2Yd_20zH_vfi0x4tSM8OuXArHkoslwJzQ" data-is-external-image="true"  alt="View Color Tips" /></figure></p>
<figcaption align = "center">View Color Tips</figcaption>

<hr>
<h2 id="detail-5-hex-input-and-more">Detail 5: Hex Input and More</h2>
<p>While HSL (hue, saturation, and lightness) is Typogram’s chosen way to define a color, you may already have a color that you want to bring in. Simply input the hex value with or without “#” or the color names and hit enter; if it is a valid color code or name, Typogram will recognize it and set HSL values accordingly. If it is not a valid color, the app will revert to the last valid color you selected.</p>
<p><figure class="post__image"><img loading="lazy" src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/CgcPBQl3FkEvVdSMw1gKEgHP1jObxdKTjbw4Ir4KwASnap2it1-MVAxdHHAZBc4At1Ve3AZRu6WF43AqPrSHGc9AiaKJT3k8j9aRh9AYF6RxzIvLg220sZe9PXXah2xHfpA-au0E7OBu-8a9ba3Htfa9yR39YmNGIGvCs7AE0d5RHf095jvQAeIOJg" data-is-external-image="true"  alt="Hex Input and More" /></figure></p>
<figcaption align = "center">Hex Input and More</figcaption>

<hr>
<h1 id="save--access-brand-color-swatches">Save &amp; Access Brand Color Swatches</h1>
<p>Once the brand colors are chosen, they are saved and can be accessed via the color swatch panel. We think this will make it easy to select, design and test once you are in the logo editor.</p>
<p><figure class="post__image"><img loading="lazy" src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/2VMbHDW27dpZG-PQA_WwEkSQerq1-InyFN6obJAm3bEJYuv9v2aKaYW7jJJi_-Ch8yl82e41uuMoVfffXBy62whkvEDWgEi251z73c2nXbU0pOtNI4xrwrL6ljZu4-K7b-fkwduaIFflmY6Pm5lp-zaKRXQYiZrmfnZrFvcCTwcU3A9zcVHnhs7rhA" data-is-external-image="true"  alt="Save &amp; Access Brand Color Swatches" /></figure></p>

</form><hr>
<p>Last week was eventful and, based on one’s stock portfolio, painful. Over the years that I worked at Adobe, I bought into the <a href="https://g.co/kgs/uzvnbm" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ADBE</a> stock through labor (RSU) and money (ESPP). A big portion of my net worth is held in ADBE stock, and that stock sunk 20% on a single day — the day they announced Adobe would acquire Figma for $20 billion. </p>
<p>This newsletter series started on Aug 2nd, 2021, days after I left my position at the Adobe. Prior to founding <a href="https://typogram.co/">Typogram</a>, I spent a year and a half working on <a href="https://www.adobe.com/products/xd.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Adobe XD</a> and five years on another Adobe acquisition Typekit (now called <a href="https://fonts.adobe.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Adobe Fonts</a>). I felt the blow on multiple levels. One that I was once devoted to Adobe XD, spending days and nights trying to win the battle with Figma, but now the acquisition announces Adobe XD’s premature defeat. One that I mentioned earlier — the blow in my wallet.</p>
<h2 class="header-with-anchor-widget">$20 billion is four times over-priced</h2>
<p>Let’s begin with the wallet blow. Not every investor of ADBE stock is like me, who held a grudge because they worked on the internal competitor product. Why do other investors hate the acquisition, as shown by the stock price plunge? The simple answer is that the $20 billion price tag is too expensive.</p>
<p>Startup evaluation is complex, but there are shortcuts we can take to do a rough estimate. We can try to estimate in two different ways:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Figma last raised funds at a valuation of $10 billion in June 2021. At first glance, it might make sense: Figma is doing so well that it doubled its valuation in a year of time between 2021 and 2022. Except 2021 is at the peak of startup valuation, most startups cut their valuation by a lot in 2022, including those doing well. Taking Canva, another contender in the design space, for example, its valuation declined from $40 billion in 2021 to $26 billion in 2022, despite that they are doing well. Apply the same ratio to Figma, the Figma 2022 valuation is estimated to be <strong>$6.5 billion</strong>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Another way to peek at a startup’s valuation is by revenue and growth multiplier. High-growth startups may have a high multiplier like 10x. Figma is targeted to hit $400 million in revenue, assuming it has already hit the target revenue, multiple by a high multiplier of 10x — its valuation is at <strong>$4 billion</strong>.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>I think the actual value of Figma is around <strong>$5 billion</strong>. $20 billion would be four times overpriced; hence investors dropped the stock on the heel of the acquisition announcement. Nobody likes a bad deal. To reach such a deal, it must be Adobe begged to acquire Figma; it was not a level field negotiation. Why does Adobe need Figma so badly?</p>
<h2 class="header-with-anchor-widget">Organization chart oddity</h2>
<p>Reading Figma’s CEO’s <a href="https://www.figma.com/blog/a-new-collaboration-with-adobe/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">blog post</a> announcement, after the acquisition, he will report to David Wadhwani, not Scott Belsky, which stands out as odd to me. Scott Belsky is the person in charge of Creative Cloud. You may see him in every Adobe Max keynote talking about Creative Cloud products. After the acquisition announcement, the “design Twitter” jokingly mocked up Figma’s app icon in Creative Cloud form — it was transparent to everyone that Figma would be part of Creative Cloud; then why does the Figma CEO not report to the head of Creative Cloud?</p>
<figure class="post__image"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:best,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F92e1ff16-07b9-4384-9c05-550563b1c66a_1587x1080.jpeg" data-is-external-image="true"  alt="Internet meme about Figma being acquired by Adobe"><figcaption>Internet meme about Figma being acquired by Adobe</figcaption></figure>
<p>The answer, I now speculate as an outsider, is that David Wadhwani is the one who led and pushed through the acquisition, not Scott Belsky; therefore, the new Figma org reports to him. </p>
<p>Adobe has invested heavily in Adobe XD, <a href="https://blog.adobe.com/en/publish/2015/10/05/introducing-project-comet-a-new-tool-for-designing-and-prototyping-user-experiences" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">first announced to public as Project Comet in Oct 2015, 7 years ago</a>. While it is surely not as popular as Figma, it is nothing less than a successful product, strengthening the Creative Cloud ecosystem. According to the <a href="https://uxtools.co/survey-2021/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">2021 design tools survey</a> (the latest, 2022 survey has yet to come out), Adobe XD is the 3rd most popular UI design tool and 2nd most popular UI prototyping tool. Compared to <a href="https://uxtools.co/survey-2020/#ui-design" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">2020 design tools survey</a>, Adobe XD is on the rise — it jumped from 3rd to 2nd place in UI prototyping category and shortened the gap between itself and 2nd place in the UI design category:</p>
<figure class="post__image"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F09679d21-7de2-48fc-b234-7a72678f6d89_1778x604.png" data-is-external-image="true"  alt="Design Tools Survey 2020 vs. 2021, source: uxtools.co"><figcaption>Design Tools Survey 2020 vs. 2021, source: uxtools.co</figcaption></figure>
<p>As a user, we may view products as 1 or 0 — if I don’t use it, it almost doesn’t exist. But the market is vast and diverse; you might be surprised how many companies are using Adobe XD over Figma. All this is to say: </p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Adobe XD is a considerable investment; Adobe has worked on it for more than seven years; </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Adobe XD is rising, not failing</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Figma not reporting to the head of Creative Cloud sends a bad signal to me, almost a red flag. Did a group of business people decide to buy Figma without any serious consideration of Adobe XD’s effort? Have the “decision makers” ever even opened Adobe XD before they come to the conclusion that Adobe must have Figma for $20 billion? For Adobe to either admit XD’s defeat and have Figma annex XD, or strategize upon having two similar products grow side by side, it should most certainly involve the team who spent 7+ years building Adobe’s equivalence of Figma. It would be ignorant not to consult with them and have a thorough analysis of what Adobe XD is lacking in comparison to Figma and how difficult is it to build the missing parts.</p>
<h2 class="header-with-anchor-widget">Conflict of interest</h2>
<p>Who is David Wadhwani, the person Figma is going to report to? I have never heard of this name while working at Adobe. A little further research shows he joined Adobe in June 2021, just over a year ago. His last position prior was Venture Partner at venture capital firm <a href="https://greylock.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Greylock</a>. In his <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/davidwadhwani/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">LinkedIn</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/dwadhwani" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Twitter </a>profile, he is still a partner at Greylock; unknown to me whether it is outdated information due to lack of updates. Greylock invested in Figma in Series A, B, C, D, and E! Figma Series A’s price was $0.2 per share; it 200x’ed at the acquisition deal. I think there is a conflict of interest for David to lead the acquisition of Figma in Adobe, if David is still working for Greylock or if he has personally invested in Figma. </p>

<p>For context, <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2022/04/27/elon-musk-wins-shareholder-lawsuit-over-the-companys-2point6-billion-solarcity-acquisition.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Elon Musk got sued by shareholders</a> in a similar situation. Musk’s company Tesla acquired SolarCity, a company founded by Musk’s cousins and backed by Musk. However, Musk did win the lawsuit in the end. With the context in mind, I believe it is reasonable to raise the question about conflict of interest, while it needs more investigation to allege there is actual wrongdoing. </p>
<h2 class="header-with-anchor-widget">“Forward-looking statements”</h2>
<div id="§forward-looking-statements" class="header-anchor-widget">
<div class="header-anchor-widget-button-container">
<div class="header-anchor-widget-button"> </div>
</div>
</div>
<p>While there is nothing I look forward to in this transaction, the “forward-looking statements” disclaimer from Figma’s CEO is <a href="https://www.figma.com/blog/a-new-collaboration-with-adobe/#disclaimer" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">an interesting read</a>, which I quote below:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Each of the forward-looking statements we make in this communication involves risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from these forward-looking statements. Factors that might cause or contribute to such differences include, but are not limited to: expected revenues, cost savings, synergies and other benefits from the proposed transaction, such as <strong>Adobe’s ability to enhance Creative Cloud by adding Figma’s collaboration-first product design capabilities and the effectiveness of Figma’s technology, might not be realized within the expected time frames or at all</strong> and costs or difficulties relating to integration matters, including but not limited to customer and employee retention, might be greater than expected…</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I painfully laugh at this disclaimer, for how true it might be. I think the best outcome for users is for Figma to remain largely the same. But even with Adobe keeping Figma as independent as it can be, it will develop and grow at a much slower pace since there will be no venture capital funds pouring in, and Adobe’s resources drained to pay off the acquisition cost. The only winner is Figma investors. This acquisition is a lose-lose-lose situation for Adobe, Figma, and the design community. </p>
<p>With accelerated stock vesting triggered by the acquisition, a lot of Figma employees will jump ship to their next adventure. It is hard to blame them — they are rich now, so why not become angel investors or found their own company? That is the bright side of this acquisition — more competition is always better. Figma helped Adobe XD become better, and vice versa: “<a href="https://help.figma.com/hc/en-us/articles/360039818874-Create-advanced-animations-with-smart-animate" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Smart Animate</a>” came from Adobe XD to Figma; “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5JaQBWSB88w&amp;ab_channel=AdobeCreativeCloud" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Live Co-editing</a>” came from Figma to Adobe XD (Ah Yes, Adobe XD supports multi-player mode for three years now). I await to see what the design tool experts from Figma will bring to the world next.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>We have been busy building our favorite logo design tool. Here are the features we have been working for September.<span style="font-weight: 400;"> Missed the previous updates? See </span><a href="https://typogram.co/blog/typogram-product-update-june-2022/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">June</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><a href="https://typogram.co/blog/typogram-product-update-july-2022/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">July</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and </span><a href="https://typogram.co/blog/typogram-product-update-no3/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">August.</span></a></p>
<hr>
<h1>Save Multiple Projects on the Cloud</h1>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">An exciting update to Typogram is that projects can now be saved to the cloud under user accounts. Until now, our features were developed with a saving mechanism using the browser’s localStorage. However, saving projects to the cloud is essential -- We can finally do that now! A notable feature we supported is to merge artboards created and stored locally before logging in with artboards fetched from the cloud after logging in; this way, no progress is lost.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We reached out to every pre-order customer to talk to them about their brand needs, and these conversations are so helpful to us in making a better product. One of the first things we discovered was the need for multiple branding projects, contrary to what we initially presumed. It is a use case that we must support since some of our pre-order customers have already bought multiple licenses for multiple branding projects. I can also imagine this feature helpful for other scenarios, like deciding between different brand names.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Look at the screencast below that loads different projects from the cloud. We store which step you are at with each project, and upon loading, scroll to your current step so you can quickly get back to where you were at and continue designing your brand:</span></p>

<h1> </h1>
<h1>Overcoming Technical Challenges</h1>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We also overcame a significant engineering challenge. In the last few weeks, we had rendering issues with the editable icons. We thought it was a problem with the third-party library we used to render the variable font files — a font technology we used for the editable icons. Without fixing the issue, our editable icon project was at a halt — there was no point in spending more time developing icons that could not be properly rendered. We have to find a solution quickly to resume the editable icon project.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We decided to dive into the codebase of the third-party library in search of a solution. It was a significant challenge at first — unfamiliar with the code, we had no idea what was going on between the lines. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, after patience and help from the author of the library, the code started to make sense line by line. We dug deep and revealed some information that we configured in the variable font file was not properly interpreted by the library. We can change the library to interpret it better, or there was an easier way — write the information into the font in the way the library wanted to handle it. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It was a surprising turn that led us to the font creation software we used, and a simple change in the font script fixed the problem. The debugging process not only unblocked our icon project but also helped us understand better the third-party library we relied on. It also heightened our understanding of variable font technology in general. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">...And that’s it for this month!</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since we launched our </span><a href="https://typogram.co/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">pre-order</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in April, we have been making consistent progress towards launching Typogram, see our </span><a href="https://typogram.co/blog/typogram-product-update-june-2022/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">June</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><a href="https://typogram.co/blog/typogram-product-update-july-2022/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">July</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and </span><a href="https://typogram.co/blog/typogram-product-update-no3/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">August</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> product updates. The journey to develop Typogram is like any other adventure, we overcame many obstacles and met new unforeseeable challenges. Recently, after many thoughtful internal discussions and evaluations, we decided to push back our product launch date.</span></p>
<h1> </h1>
<h1><span style="font-weight: 400;">Updating Launch Schedule</span></h1>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While we are full steam ahead developing Typogram, we sometimes overestimate ourselves and underestimate our tasks. In order to ship a quality product, unfortunately, we have to ask you to wait a little longer — our targeted launch date changes from September to January. We are very sorry for the delay and hope you stay with us. If the launch postponement changes your mind about us, we understand entirely, and it is on us. As always, we offer full refunds. Please get in touch with hua@typogram.co to start the refund process if needed.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the last few months, we have completed: </span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">choose brand personalities</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">choose logo typeface</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">logo editor that includes font menu, property editor, icon search/editor module</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">part of account management</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Though much has been accomplished, we still have to:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">finish account management with necessary backend database updates</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">revamp color palette feature</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">add brand guidelines webpage publishing features</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We think with four additional months, the rest of the work can be completed, and the product can be ready in January 2023.</span></p>
<p> </p>
<hr>
<h1><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reflections</span></h1>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Announcing pushing back the launch date was not easy. Here are personal reflections from each of us:</span></p>
<h3><strong>Wenting</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In hindsight, underestimating the work scope is the main mistake that set us back — for example, I underestimated the workload surrounding backend development. The account feature is taking much longer and diminishes my momentum. The </span><a href="https://typogram.co/blog/typogram-product-update-july-2022/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">editable icon project</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> my co-founder is working on also shares the same problem. We need to look at this problem internally and find solutions to estimate work scope and set deadlines more accurately. We have internal deadlines for each project, and missing them often hurts our morale and momentum. </span></p>
<h3><strong>Hua</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reflecting upon the progress with editable icons, the main thing that sets us back is the lack of understanding of the technical and design processes. Editable icons are something new - deciding and trying out different designs and tech specs were time-consuming and a process of trial and error. Because of this, I underestimated how long it took to create these icons. As I learn more, I understand this creation process better, which guides me to make better, more accurate estimations of project milestones. </span></p>
<p> </p>
<h1><span style="font-weight: 400;">Looking Forward</span></h1>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After we emailed our customers and community about delaying the launch date, surprising to us, we received nothing but positive support from our pre-oder customers and our community. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While we continue our journey towards our product launch in January</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> 2023, we will keep sharing what we built and learned via our monthly updates and we look forward to building Typogram together with our great community, your feedback, and advice.</span></p>

<h1> </h1>
<h1>Partnering up!</h1>
<p>We are partnering up with <a href="https://thetypefounders.com/">the Type Founders </a>and adding premium fonts our collections. My co-founder and I came from the font world, and the friends we made along the way got us where we are today with Typogram and further! We are officially partnering up with The Type Founders(TTF) and incorporating TTF's exhilarating library of fonts (they sparkle joy in me when I look at them). Featuring work from renowned font foundries in the likes of P22 Type Foundry, The Freight Collection, Laura Worthington Design, Mark Simonson Studio, and <a href="https://thetypefounders.com/#foundries">more</a>, we will be seeing these exclusive premium fonts available in Typogram to design logos with them in the short future:</p>

<h1> </h1>
<h1>More Editable Icons</h1>
<p>We continue the work on the editable icons. This month, we are introducing icons with three style axis. Each axis can manipulate a specific visual part of the icon.</p>
<p>For example, the mountain icon can be manipulated using: Hill, Snow, and Ratio. Each of these controls the corresponding visual aspect of the mountain to allow manipulation.</p>
<figure class="post__image"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://typogram.co/blog/media/posts/31/mountain-editableIcon.gif" alt="editable icon, mountain" width="859" height="469"></figure>
<figure class="post__image"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://typogram.co/blog/media/posts/31/heart-editableIcon.gif" alt="editable icon, heart" width="859" height="469"></figure>
<p>Heart icon is controlled by Ratio, pointiness and concavity. Through these three axis, you can manipulate the way heart looks.</p>
<h1> </h1>
<h1>Thank you</h1>
<p>As always, thank you for supporting us! You motivate us to keep climbing the mountains of impossibles. The best way to support us today is by <a href="https://checkout.stripe.com/pay/cs_live_a1885zZH03rDmuqgqw28eGNUhc8fMED6FPgUb0Yb0yen7izexehXZT01JQ#fidkdWxOYHwnPyd1blppbHNgWkJxbVxKUUJpcmpOMlJCU2lCMD1jZ2x1fTU1T052ampSRm4nKSd1aWxrbkB9dWp2YGFMYSc%2FJ2FXM2NfZjNgV2M2STZwNTU1NCcpJ3dgY2B3d2B3SndsYmxrJz8nbXFxdXY%2FKipxfHVqYndkaCtmaioneCUl">pre-ordering</a>, but if you don’t need Typogram right now, you can support us in other ways.</p>

<p>How is Typogram development going?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We recently sent out our July build in public update to our preorder customers about Typogram's development. <span style="font-weight: 400;">We have been busy building Typogram. Here are the features we have been working for July. Missed the previous updates? See</span> <a href="https://typogram.co/blog/typogram-product-update-june-2022/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">June</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> here.</span></p>
<h1> </h1>
<h1>Editable Icons</h1>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Editable icons are an essential feature in Typogram that allows you to customize your design without tinkering with icons’ tricky vector points and bezier curves. Each icon is designed with multiple “style” sliders, and by specifying values on the sliders, you can customize the icon’s dimensions, shapes, and appearances to your liking and what fits your logo the best.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Taking this flower icon as an example, you can control the ratio of width and height, as well as the appearance of the flower, without any path manipulation, a complex and time-consuming task, even for professionals. We will continue releasing icon updates until our official launch.</span></p>
