                    <img src="https://typogram.co/blog/media/posts/57/blogPost_LaunchUpdate_Cover_2-2.png" alt="Typogram&#x27;s December 2023 launch" />
                <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Happy New Year! Recently, we launched the latest version of Typogram on Product Hunt. Our main goals for this launch were deliver our latest product before 2023 ends and experiment with our launch strategy. We want to devise a marketing plan to maximize our product growth during this launch period. Our solution was a month-long marketing campaign, with a product hunt launch as a culminating event. Now that the launch has ended, we want to share our tips and learnings for this launch in this post.¬†</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Quick Stats for Launch Day¬†</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Here are some quick stats for day of the launch:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Build in Public Newsletter subscriber + 10</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">+ 262 registered users the week of the launch</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">3 sales on the day of launch (with more sales before and after the launch during the sales window)</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">No.8 product of the day - Our peak position was No.2</span></li>
</ul>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Helpful Strategies¬†</span></h2>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">No.1: Marketing Idea Bank</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To help us quickly come up with things to share and promote during the weeks before launch, we create an idea bank for content. For each week, we identified a theme/ idea we wanted to share around our launch. We then searched our content library of relevant posts and visuals and developed them into tweets. This aimed to grow our newsletter subscribers and reach on Twitter.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">By the end, we gained the most followers on Twitter. In comparison, the newsletter grew less in subscribers. This could be because Twitter‚Äôs algorithm deprioritizes tweets with links, especially Substack links. Looking back, the idea bank is a tool I will keep implementing because it makes marketing easy. Like most introverts, I struggle with finding things to say on social media, especially regarding sales and marketing. In the future, I want to develop an idea bank for every single marketing event.¬†</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">No.2: Running a month-long sale during the launch day</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We previously ran a sale on the Product Hunt platform on launch day. This time, we ran two parallel sales ‚Äì one on our own and one through a Lifetime Deals Facebook group. The price for the basic tier (our single-brand lifetime license ) was the same for both sales, and we ran both sales for about a month. Our (own) campaign performed well and generated several sales weeks before and after the launch. The promo at the Facebook group was interesting and gave us several paid customers who ordered multiple licenses. I will share more about our experience and learning with the LTD Facebook group channel in a separate post.¬†</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Overall, running a sales campaign parallel to the launch was a good move. It helped us talk about our product a lot more. Next time, I want to experiment with a shorter sales window, like a two-week sale, rather than a monthly long sale, especially for the LTD group.¬†</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Highlights from Launch</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The launch day was a day full of ups and downs. The launch‚Äôs best part is seeing our community‚Äôs love and support, which can't be measured in numbers. Here are some top highlights.</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">No.1 ‚Äì Tofu is loved</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Throughout the launch, Tofu was liked and tweeted many times. Her face was seeing 11.4k times around Twitter. I think she may be a nano influencer now. üòÅ</span></p>

                <blockquote>
<p><strong>How is Typogram development going?</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since our last update, we have been working on two highly requested features: multi-line logo layout and adding extra lines of text. We are also working on a special AI feature. All of these are available soon in the upcoming roll-out!</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Upcoming: Multi-Lines Logo Layout</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ever wanted to create a stacked logo or a design splitting across multiple lines? You could accomplish this easily with our new logo layout feature. You‚Äôll be able to add a line break to split your logo into a new line or remove line breaks to adjust your logo layout, creating layouts like a vertical or stacked design. When you get a creative idea, you want to get the ideas out of your head. We get that, so we took extra time to ensure it‚Äôs easy for you to control the details of the logo layout. You can play with line spacing and alignment and preview them easily with selected brand fonts.¬†</span></p>
<figure class="post__image" ><img loading="lazy" src="https://typogram.co/blog/media/posts/56/logoLayout_3.gif" alt="Multi-Lines logo layout feature¬†" width="1440" height="900">
<figcaption ><span style="font-weight: 400;">Multi-Lines logo layout feature¬†</span></figcaption>
</figure>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Upcoming: Adding Extra Lines of Text</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Have a short tagline below the logo? Want to add a small text like a founding date, a structure like ‚ÄúLLC‚Äù or a category like ‚Äúmusic‚Äù? Soon inside the logo editor, you can add extra lines to your logo, allowing you to create infinite additional logo variations of your brand. You can then design your brand new tagline logo in the logo editor. Change your mind? No problem ‚Äì you can also remove the extra text element. This is one of the most popular feature requests we‚Äôve gotten, and we can‚Äôt wait to have you try it in the app.¬†</span></p>

</figure>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Upcoming: Magic Fairy Dust ‚Äî AI-Generated Icon</span></h2>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is something special we‚Äôve been preparing. We are adding AI to Typogram!</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> We pride ourselves on being a tool that inspires curiosity and creativity instead of randomly generating results. Embracing AI as an enhancement, not a replacement, we took a cautious approach to adding AI to amplify creativity and innovation while staying true to our product‚Äôs original DNA and distinctly different from generated logos. We‚Äôll share more about this exciting update soon! You can get a first look at our Product Hunt page on December 12th.</span><a href="https://www.producthunt.com/products/typogram"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Follow here</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for our launch.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Upcoming: Try Typogram as a Guest</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We‚Äôve been aiming to make Typogram easier to try. We are now inching closer to that goal by allowing anyone to play with Typogram as a guest without needing to sign-up. Anyone can try our beginner-friendly branding and logo design features directly without making an account. Progress is saved upon account creation.</span></p>

<h1>Launch Snapshots¬†</h1>
<p>So far, we have launched Typogram twice on Product Hunt. For both launches, we mostly bet on the launch event itself. The goal has always been to secure a top spot so our website can gain traffic marketing buzz and acquire paid users for our app.¬†</p>
<p>Here are some snapshots from our previous launches:¬†</p>
<ul>
<li>Pre-order launch, March 2022</li>
<li>Alpha launch, April 2023</li>
<li>Upcoming Launch, December 2023</li>
</ul>

<h2 class="header-with-anchor-widget">Pre-order Launch, March 2022¬†</h2>
<p>This is our first launch for Typogram on Product Hunt. We mainly prepared a few days before the launch by sharing snippets of our product and a teaser in our newsletter, Twitter, and Reddit. And promoted throughout <em>t</em>he day. Our results:¬†</p>
<ul>
<li>No.10 Product of the Day</li>
<li>16 pre-orders</li>
<li>1500 traffic during the first two weeks of launch¬†</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>A key takeaway from this first launch: the first few hours are extra important¬†</strong></p>

<h2 class="header-with-anchor-widget">Alpha launch, April 2023</h2>
<p>On April this year, we launched our alpha on Product Launch. This time, we took more time to prepare, contacting our community of friends and previous customers in advance to gather support, especially the first few hours of the launch, a lesson we learned from our pre-order launch.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, we were locked in the Product Hunt landing page jail for the initial vital hours. Typogram only made it onto the homepage many hours later. Even though we felt like we were rubbed out of the top three spots, our community carried us through.¬†</p>
<ul>
<li>No. 5 Product of the Day</li>
<li>100 new users on the launch day and 130 new sign-ups the following week<br><br></li>
<li>9 converted to paid user, 4% conversion</li>

<h2 class="header-with-anchor-widget">Upcoming Launch, December 2023</h2>
<h3 class="header-with-anchor-widget">New Strategy</h3>
<p>Reflecting on our past launches, every time we optimized our marketing for the launch, our focus was always 100% on the actual event.¬†</p>
<p>Learning from our April launch, we adjusted our thinking. We realize PH launches can be a vehicle instead of a single event. Instead of considering the PH launch as the solitary main event, we could see it as the culminating event. That way, we can grow and build hype around the product in multiple ways.</p>
<div class="pullquote">
<p>You can <a href="https://www.producthunt.com/products/typogram">follow</a> our actions here! üöÄ</p>
</div>
<p><strong>So, we are trying a new experiment.¬†</strong></p>
<h3 class="header-with-anchor-widget">First Three Weeks</h3>
<p>Rather than promoting intensely for two weeks right before and concentrating solely on the launch event, we have been promoting the whole month, with the first three weeks centered on broadening our reach. We created a content bank from our previous blog posts and newsletter issues. We then crafted tweets, posts, and graphics and scheduled them on our Twitter accounts. We are focusing on:¬†</p>
<ul>
<li>Grow subscribers for our build-in-public newsletter¬†<br><br></li>
<li>Gain free account users and increase exposure to Typogram<br><br></li>
<li>Increase our Twitter audience before the launch to maximize reach</li>
</ul>
<h3 class="header-with-anchor-widget">Final Week</h3>
<p>In the final week, we‚Äôll focus more intensely on Product Hunt, utilizing methods we learned from previous launches.¬†</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Gather the support of our friends from different time zones¬†</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Get active on product hunt community forums¬†</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Mystery launch photoshoot (this is something fun we are doing- can‚Äôt wait to share with you more)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Launch exclusive post with call the action to PH launch soon page¬†</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 class="header-with-anchor-widget">How is it going?</h3>
<p>We are in the third week, and We‚Äôve been scheduling and posting tweets. So far, it‚Äôs working great. I've been getting more active on Twitter, and now working on Reddit. Next week, I'll start doing more behind-the-scenes work exclusively for the launch.¬†</p>

<p><strong>How is Typogram development going?</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Since our last update, we have been busy implementing features and changes per your feedback and suggestions. Here is what we've working in the last few weeks!¬†</p>

<h2>Faster Typogram, Rebuilt from the Ground</h2>
</div>
</figure>
</div>
<p>In our latest update, we unveil the monumental transformation Typogram has undergone. We‚Äôve meticulously rewritten our app from the ground up, transitioning our code base framework from Vue to Svelte.¬†</p>
<p>This transformative overhaul involved three months of intense code crunch, manifesting in 225 commits, 77,175 lines of code in additions, 25,969 deletions, and countless cups of coffee.¬†</p>

<h2><strong>What does this mean for Typogram users?¬†</strong></h2>
<p>A remarkably faster app with optimized rendering and tremendously improved user experience. We‚Äôve made countless improvements and bug fixes. A few major ones:¬†</p>
<h4>Improving Overall User Experience</h4>
<p>This overhaul was not merely a switch but a journey where we painstakingly crushed reported bugs, resolved technical debt, and discovered more efficient ways to execute, all aimed at enhancing the quality of Typogram for our users. Our new app, now optimized for performance and rendering, effectively addressed and resolved many previous issues, such as font loading and rendering.</p>
<h4>Complete Rework of Redo-Undo Feature</h4>
<p>We completely rebuilt this feature and fixed the ‚Äúghost artboard flashback‚Äù issue. Also, by switching the data storage method, the feature can now handle a much longer edit history, allowing you to go way back in artboard history if you ever find regrets in your design journey.</p>
<h4>Brand New Login Page</h4>
<p>Our new modular code base has significantly enhanced our development process, enabling us to add new features more easily and quickly.¬†</p>
<p>Previously, we used a pre-packaged login page, which occasionally had users stuck in an infinite login loop. We didn‚Äôt have control over this external code to fix the bug. With our new custom login page, we have now resolved the issue. It is more reliable, beautiful, and has nice user experience details.¬†</p>

                <h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Background¬†</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Before we start, I would like to give you some background about me and my startup.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">My name is Hua Shu, and together with my co-founder, <a href="https://build.typogram.co/" title="Wenting Zhang" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Wenting Zhang</a>, we are building a logo design tool for founders called Typogram.¬†</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Typogram Timeline Snapshot</span></h3>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">2021-¬† customer discovery, product research, newsletters/content developments¬†</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">2022 - preorder landing page launch¬†</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">2023 - public alpha launch¬†</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We launched a landing page pre-order for Typogram in March 2022 and a public launch in April 2023. Before that, we did a lot of customer discovery, product development, and user testing. So far, we have crossed 1,500 registered users and generated over $5,000 from Lifetime deals, primarily through organic channels.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In this post, I want to share some frugal methods that worked for product validation and growth.¬†</span></p>

<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">MVP and Product Validation¬†</span></h2>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Strategy No.1: Simplified No-Code Version of Feature<br><br></span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We are a tiny, two-people, and bootstrapped team. Our resources, such as money, time, knowledge, motivation, and productivity, are limited.¬†</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Early in our product development process, we wanted to ensure we could monetize the features.¬†</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To test this quickly, we made one of our core features, "identifying brand personality," into a mini product, a workshop kit with no-code tools. No code tools are also popular with users in our niche. This </span><a href="https://typogram.co/workshop"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Brand Personality Workshop Kit</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is structured like a workbook with instructions and actionable for participants. Depending on the capabilities of specific no-code platforms, we even intimated what we were thinking for user experience.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">During this time, we also started writing </span><a href="https://build.typogram.co/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">newsletters</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for our audience (see the newsletter section). We launched our mini product on Gumroad and in our newsletters to see if anyone would pay. In the end, we got a couple of customers, which was enough of a quick validation for us for this app feature.¬†</span></p>

<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Product Think: Hacking No-Code/Low-Code Tools¬†</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">No-Code tools are a group of tools that allow you to build applications with a graphical interface (without code). Low-Code does the same but may enable you to insert code. For Typogram, we use no-code tools extensively in our product development process. Our no-code tech stack is Webflow, Notion, Figma, Make, and Airtable.¬†</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">No-Code / Low-Code tools are excellent for building simplified features while conserving engineering resources. It allows you to build quickly and test for validation. <a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1u3W91u40Obn-vgL33zilnV9LNZQWjLSCFx6nHgz9YXo/copy" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">I created this kit</a> for brainstorming if there is a simplified version of a feature I can create with no code. Feel free to use this for your process (Click "Make a Copy" to duplicate my kit).¬†</span></p>

<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">No-Code Tools We've Used for Typogram</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Below are no-code tools we have used for Typogram I recommend with fantastic free tiers. I'm not affiliated with any of these tools. Learning difficulties are mainly determined by how long I spend learning the tools initially, how fast I can achieve results, and any prior knowledge needed.</span></p>
<h4><span style="font-weight: 400;">Notion</span></h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Learning Difficulty: 3/5¬†</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Notion is a productivity and note-taking app capable of creating shareable web pages. You can also connect and embed other apps, like Google Drive, websites, and Figma.</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Interaction capabilities: drag and drop, gallery view, table, sharable page</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Use Case: Blog, Feature Creation, Knowledge Base, Issues Tracking</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Typogram Use Case: core feature validation and mini-product, product management</span></li>
</ul>
<h4><span style="font-weight: 400;">Webflow¬†</span></h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Learning Difficulty: 5 /5</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Webflow is a low-code web builder. The editor is more intuitive if you know a bit about web programming (HTML, CSS, and even JavaScript). The style editor of Webflow allows you to create a landing page quickly.¬†</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Interaction capabilities: Website, CMS¬†</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Use Case: Websites¬†</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Typogram Use Case: landing page and prototypes</span></li>
</ul>
<figure class="post__image" ><img loading="lazy" src="https://typogram.co/blog/media/posts/53/typogram-designSystem-webflow.png" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" srcset="https://typogram.co/blog/media/posts/53/responsive/typogram-designSystem-webflow-xs.png 300w ,https://typogram.co/blog/media/posts/53/responsive/typogram-designSystem-webflow-sm.png 480w ,https://typogram.co/blog/media/posts/53/responsive/typogram-designSystem-webflow-md.png 768w ,https://typogram.co/blog/media/posts/53/responsive/typogram-designSystem-webflow-lg.png 1024w"  alt="Typogram design system" width="1440" height="900">
<figcaption ><span style="font-weight: 400;">Typogram‚Äôs design system page on Webflow</span></figcaption>
</figure>
<h4><span style="font-weight: 400;">Make¬†</span></h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Learning Difficulty: 4 /5</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Make is a great automation tool with a generous free plan. Once you are used to the user interface, the editor is intuitive and allows you to create automation flows between different apps. I use Make to set up part of the payment system for Typogram. It saved us time from writing painful integrations and digging through APIs. However, tutorials can be challenging because of their recent name change from Integromat to Make.¬†</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Interaction capabilities: Connect and create automation from a variety of apps</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Use Cases: Payment, leads tracking, content creation</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Typogram Use Case: Payment &amp; License Code Delivery</span></li>
</ul>
<h4><span style="font-weight: 400;">Google Sheet</span></h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Learning Difficulty: 2 /5</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Excel on Google. Any Google suite product is very automation-friendly because most automation tools will offer Google products to connect in its free tier. You can also write simple code via Google App Script to interact with your data. There are also lots of tutorials available.¬†</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Interaction capabilities: data creation / updating data</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Use Case: Data Storage, Delivery, User feedback tracking, leads tracking</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Typogram Scenario: License redemption code storage and generation</span></li>
</ul>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Strategy No.2:¬† Pre-Order with Landing Page¬†</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After user testing and mini-product launches, we launched a pre-order for Typogram in March 2022. We offered a discounted lifetime deal for a single-brand license for this pre-order. Users can edit their logo forever inside our app as long as it's for the same brand.¬†</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At this point, we have yet to complete coding for the entire tool, like account management and payment. We wanted to gauge the interest first with our current set of features.¬†</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On the landing page, we had a demo video of our features, made using Webflow, which we still use for our product (if you go to our landing page now, you can still see the video). We also collected testimonials from our user testing sessions to feature on the landing page as social proofs.¬†</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We launched this on Product Hunt and in the channels we've been developing (our newsletters) and got about 16 paid customers and 1,500 site visits in the first two weeks. Here is a </span><a href="https://typogram.co/blog/what-we-learned-from-launching-our-startup-on-product-hunt/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">detailed post</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> if you wish to see the stats from that launch.¬†</span></p>

<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Find Your First 10 Customers and First 100 Registered Users¬†</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Build it, and they will come, right? Unfortunately, no - : (¬†</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">My hard lessons learned: you have to get tractions from "do things that don't scale."¬†</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For Typogram, most of these come down to posting, sharing, and creating content around our product and topics potential users are excited about, followed by (mini) product/side project launches.¬†</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Typogram was publicly launched in April 2023 and now has over 1,500 registered users. We have been successful with content marketing and Engineering as marketing for growth.¬†</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Write content your potential new users will like. You can find topics for these by either interviewing them or searching on communities like Quora or Reddit. Then, find a platform where your users live and share your content consistently.¬†</span></p>

<h4><span style="font-weight: 400;">Newsletter¬†</span></h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I wish someone told me sooner about newsletters - the great thing about them is that you can start one even if you don't have a product. I highly recommend this strategy because you are not tied to the platform, and you can start creating a community and finding supporters immediately.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Typogram has two weekly newsletters: a </span><a href="https://build.typogram.co/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">built-in public newsletter</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> about our startup journey and </span><a href="https://fontdiscovery.typogram.co/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">a design newsletter</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, sharing beginner-friendly tips for typography, branding, and logo design.¬†</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In our newsletters, we share our startup journey. We also find topics to write about by researching what our users are interested in through Reddit. Initially, I was worried I couldn't maintain the consistency required for newsletters. Most days, it was easy to come up with topics to write about. Writing to an audience also helped me stay motivated.¬†</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Strategies for growing the newsletters include sharing on relevant communities, like Reddit, Indiehackers, and Twitter, and cross-promotion with other newsletters.</span></p>
<h4><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reddit</span></h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reddit is an excellent place filled with communities of all sorts of interests. A proud Redditor since 2010s, Reddit is my preferred platform. Redditors hate spamming, and mods can permanently ban you from the site if you break the rules of their communities. In most subreddits, you will find rules on the right-hand side specifying community rules.¬†</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The most efficient way to market on Reddit is to ask for feedback about my project and focus on being helpful. Another useful technique is to filter posts by "Hot" and look at what topics people have written about that the followers of the subreddits already liked.¬†</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You can then use these as prompts to create your content and posts. Lastly, you can be helpful in the comments and subtly plug your products. Comments are less moderated.¬†</span></p>
<h4><span style="font-weight: 400;">Power-up: F5Bot</span></h4>
<p><a href="https://f5bot.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">F5Bot</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is a fantastic, free resource that helps you level up your Reddit game by allowing you to track keywords on those platforms. You will get posts with targeted keywords delivered to your inbox. I primarily use this tool to understand and engage with my potential users in the startup communities.</span></p>
<h4><span style="font-weight: 400;">Secret Hack</span></h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It is possible to become a moderator of an abandoned subreddit. Many subreddits (anywhere from under 100 to over 10k in size) have inactive moderators. If you have enough karma points, you can apply to be a mod for inactive communities. Though you will have to perform extra labor of monitoring content, it could be very effective if it's in your niche.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Engineering as Marketing¬†</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Engineering as Marketing can be more costly than other growth tactics in the short term, utilizing more time and effort in a concentrated block of time. However, if your engineering as marketing project takes off, you get a great new digital real estate, a nice traffic boost, and even SEO benefits.¬†</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For example, we launched </span><a href="https://codingfont.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Coding Font</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> as an Engineering as Marketing project for Typogram. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Because many potential users for Typogram are web devs and people who spent a lot of time in IDE, we wanted to create a fun little website where they could find their dream coding font.¬†</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When we launched Coding Font on Product Hunt, we got </span><a href="https://build.typogram.co/p/stats-of-coding-font-launch"><span style="font-weight: 400;">‚Äã‚Äã22,000 visits on launch day</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Coding Font was featured on the front page of Hackernews and on blogs like <a href="https://boingboing.net/2021/10/27/click-your-way-to-your-favorite-monospace-font.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">BoingBoing</a> and <a href="https://css-tricks.com/coding-font-game/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">CSS Tricks</a>, improving its backlink profile and site ranking. We seized this opportunity to add blog content and keywords to this site. As a result, we got newsletter sign-ups, sales, and continuous referral traffic.¬†</span></p>

<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Long-Term Growth:¬†</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">SEO/Organic Traffic via Long-Tail Keywords¬†</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">SEO gets a bad rep from email spam by link-building agencies, but it's one of the best ways to¬†</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">gain free traffic and attract potential users to your site. The most important thing about SEO: it takes time to develop and grow. Once we validated ideas for Typogram, we started paying closer attention to SEO and how we can leverage SEO to increase organic traffic.¬†</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You can target long tail keywords, which are three to five words long search queries. Long tails are usually more niche, less search volume, and less competitive. For example, we have the </span><a href="https://typogram.co/font-discovery"><span style="font-weight: 400;">FontDiscovery(our design newsletter) archive</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for Typogram for our long tail search queries. These posts give us a nice traffic boost, over 1k per month.¬†</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I highly recommend Ahrefs' YouTube lessons. Please force yourself to watch them. You won't regret it, and you might even like it.</span></p>

<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Last Words¬†</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">My last words are about ads. I researched about ads but haven‚Äôt spent money on any. Based on my learnings, I don‚Äôt think my budget will yield meaningful results.¬†</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Another thing I didn‚Äôt get a chance to talk about in this post is one-time launch channels, like Product Hunt and IndieHackers. We are also experimenting with launching in LTD (Lifetime Deals) Facebook groups soon.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I plan to update this post with these launch channels once we launch in the LTD Facebook groups.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you liked this post, I would appreciate it if you could share it with someone who might find it useful.

                <blockquote>
<p><strong>How is Typogram development going?</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Since our last update, we have been busy implementing features and changes per your feedback and suggestions. Here is what we've working on this month!</p>
<h2 class="header-with-anchor-widget"><strong>Modularizing Brand Personality</strong></h2>
<p>During our <a href="https://typogram.co/blog/typogram-product-updates-no12-in-app-tutorial-videos-streamlined-brand-name-change-modularized-app-components/" title="typogram product update">last product update</a>, we shared about our new product thinking: modular steps and shareable work-in-progress. We are making Typogram more modular, making workflow between steps more flexible, and design work more shareable.¬†</p>
<p>In the last few weeks, we have been working on modularizing the Brand Personality Step. I‚Äôve been (Wenting) making two big changes to Typogram, starting with the brand personality step.¬†</p>
<h3 class="header-with-anchor-widget"><strong>Changing the Base</strong></h3>
<p>I initially built Typogram using a javascript framework called Vue. To improve the user experience, I changed the base of Typogram to Svelte. Svelte pre-renders our app and eliminates the need for loading additional JavaScript files, which our previous framework, Vue, lacked. This change will help our app run faster, improving the overall experience!</p>
<h3 class="header-with-anchor-widget"><strong>Making Parts &amp; Adding Share</strong></h3>
<p>I‚Äôve also been ‚Äúmodularizing‚Äù our app, splitting the app into smaller parts. Modularizing Typogram allows the potential for less linear workflows for users (a popular request ), makes things neater and easier to manage, and makes it possible to reuse the parts to create mini standalone apps for steps like Brand Personality.¬†</p>
<p>Here is a sneak peek of what I‚Äôve added to the Brand Personality step ‚Äì sharable social (Instagram) post that you can create and customize to share and test drive your designs immediately with your audience.</p>

                <blockquote>
<p>Not sure how to create logo, brand design, or brand kit for your new business? Don‚Äôt know how to start with fonts, color, and typography systems for your brand? Do not worry. We got you back!¬†</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Today we introduce one of our favorite tools we‚Äôve created: <a href="https://workshop.typogram.co/" title="Typogram‚Äôs Brand Personality Workshop Kit">Typogram‚Äôs Brand Personality Workshop Kit</a>. Our branding workshop kit is made for folks with little to no marketing and branding design experience and is a fun activity that will help you start thinking creatively about your company. By following the three-step exercise in our free workshop kit, you will walk away with brand personalities and visual directions for your company, giving you ideas to build your brand designs: logos, fonts, colors, and typography systems.</p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">What is brand personality?¬†</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Inside Typogram, the first thing you complete is figuring out your brand personality. A brand is a person‚Äôs feeling about a product, a service, or a company. A brand personality is a ‚Äúpersonality‚Äù or human characteristics we can assign to a brand. You can influence how people feel about your brand by creating a brand personality and then communicating the brand personality visually through the brand‚Äôs design directions, like fonts, logos, typography, colors, and imagery.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It can be overwhelming to start figuring out your brand personality, especially if you have no marketing background or have never thought about branding that way. Therefore, we created a fun, interactive workshop kit to help you identify your brand personality.¬†</span></p>

<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">What is inside our Brand Personality Workshop Kit?¬†¬†</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This kit contains:¬†</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Explanation worksheets with interactive exercises help you understand and identify brand personality</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Custom brand personality cards with visual examples¬†</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">By completing the three-step exercise in our workshop kit, you will learn, eliminate and finalize a chosen five top brand personalities, serving as visual directions and inspirations for your brand.¬†</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This workshop kit can accommodate a solopreneur or a small team of founders. It can be completed as a self-paced workshop or a collaborative team exercise. The exercise takes anywhere from 30 minutes to one hour, depending on the number of participants. We highly recommend you try this with your teammate or co-founder ‚Äì it is a great team alignment exercise to start conversations about the visions for your business. As for file formats, the workshop is available in Google Slides, Notion, and PDF, so you may elect to complete this digitally or print it out on paper to get more hands-on.¬†</span></p>

<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">How did we develop this kit?¬†</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Our brand personality workshop kit originated and evolved from Typogram‚Äôs product development process. Initially, we wanted to identify a user experience flow for the brand personality feature inside the Typogram app: how can we make the brand personality a valuable feature to the users? What specific interactions can we include at this step, and what do they look like?¬†</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With many hypotheses, we focused on shipping quickly for testing. We created this workshop using three popular No-Code tools easily accessible to our potential users: PDF, Google Slides, and Notion. Now that we have sped up the product development process using No-Code, we can focus on testing and making the UX as rewarding as possible.¬†</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The end product featured a main flow: users sort through different cards of brand personality and each time, they sort and choose using various methods: First, they identify based on a list of words and then narrow down based on images. Ultimately, users land on five words as visual themes/directions for their logos. Observing from our user testing session that branding is a starting point for conversation - we designed the workshop to work for solopreneurs or a team.¬†</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We organized user testing sessions and received great feedback. The success of user testing validated the flow and design of our brand personality feature inside Typogram! Because of the overwhelmingly positive response, we now make this kit a free resource for our community.¬†</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Access our Brand Personality Workshop Kit</span></h2>

<p><strong style="font-family: var(--editor-font-family); font-size: inherit;">How is Typogram development going?</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Since our last update, we have been busy working per your feedback and suggestions. Here is what we worked on.¬†</p>
<h1>¬†</h1>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">In-App Tutorial Videos¬†</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A popular request we received is adding tutorial videos, and we hear you! We have added short in-app tutorial videos that help you along the way in Brand Personality, Brand Color, Distinctive Logo (Logo Editor), and Kerning steps. Each video showcases the available features in that particular step. The short videos present you with how-tos, instructions, and tooltips so that you can find our helpful features. You can find the videos embedded in the learning material posts. We hope you find them useful, and please let us know if you have any feedback.</span></p>
<figure class="post__image" ><img loading="lazy" src="https://typogram.co/blog/media/posts/49/logoEditorVideoScreenshotUpdate.png" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" srcset="https://typogram.co/blog/media/posts/49/responsive/logoEditorVideoScreenshotUpdate-xs.png 300w ,https://typogram.co/blog/media/posts/49/responsive/logoEditorVideoScreenshotUpdate-sm.png 480w ,https://typogram.co/blog/media/posts/49/responsive/logoEditorVideoScreenshotUpdate-md.png 768w ,https://typogram.co/blog/media/posts/49/responsive/logoEditorVideoScreenshotUpdate-lg.png 1024w"  alt="img: in-app video inside learning material" width="786" height="536">

<h1>¬†</h1>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Streamlined Brand Name Change¬†</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Another popular request we receive is brand name change. Because Typogram offers a one-brand lifetime license, you are locked down to a brand name once you purchase a paid license. However, we understand that sometimes, accidents happen. There can be spelling errors or incorrect name entries.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The old process for the brand name change was manually sending us an email or via the chat widget. Starting today, we have a better, more streamlined process: you can initiate a name change directly in the app through your project dashboard. Under the appropriate project, click ‚ÄúRequest Change Brand Name,‚Äù to enter a new name for approval. It‚Äôll usually approve within 24 hours.</span></p>
<figure class="post__image" ><img loading="lazy" src="https://typogram.co/blog/media/posts/49/brandNameChangeEditUpdate_2-2.gif" alt="img: request to change brand name" width="1440" height="900">
<figcaption ><span style="font-weight: 400;">img: Request to change brand name</span></figcaption>
</figure>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Upcoming: Modularized App Components &amp; Expanding Brand Personality Workshop</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We are currently reworking our app from the ground up with a brand-new direction to product thinking: </span><strong>modular steps and shareable work-in-progress.</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> We take pride in our unique eight-step process for creating a professional brand, but its implementation in the app seems rigid regarding workflow adherence. You must go through a series of steps to reach the final destination‚ÄîBrand Guidelines‚Äîwhich is the only place and time where you can share your work.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The new Typogram maintains the same brand design philosophies and workflows but is much more modular and flexible. We broke ground on this new app direction with Typogram‚Äôs first step‚ÄîBrand Personality. Once completed, it will function as a modular component that can either stand alone as a mini app or serve as a segue to the full Typogram experience. The Brand Personality app will also feature a more visually stunning presentation you can save and publish.¬†</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Our plans for the future: every single step is a standalone app, much more robust, but at the same time, it is still part of the full Typogram experience. The brand design journey can start anywhere and in any order. The work product of each step is presented in a much more visually-impressive way, and you can save and share with your team or community to get feedback.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Let us know what you think of this future direction!</span></p>
<h1>¬†</h1>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hearing from You</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We‚Äôd love to hear more of your thoughts if you have already tried the software. Please share them with us by directly replying to this email or filling out this </span><a href="https://tally.so/r/mVGEQv"><span style="font-weight: 400;">very short feedback form</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. If you haven‚Äôt tried, we encourage you to create an account and use the Free Trial to play with the tool.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you encounter any issues, please help us improve by reporting the issue from inside the app or directly through </span><a href="https://tally.so/r/mOQxJ7"><span style="font-weight: 400;">here</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. You can also chat with us via the chat window inside the app. We are online during the daytime in the EST time zone (and some night time too).</span></p>

<p><strong>How is Typogram development going?</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Since our last update, we have been busy implementing features and changes per your feedback and suggestions. Here are the new features we have in the pipeline!¬†</p>
<hr>
<h1><span style="font-weight: 400;">Export Brand Guidelines PDF¬†</span></h1>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Brand Guidelines PDF feature is now available inside the app! You can create a unique guidelines page for your brand and generate a printer-friendly pdf copy to either print it out for yourself as a reminder of the key assets of your brand or share the PDF with a designer you are working with. You can find the Print PDF option on the left sidebar and top right navigation on your published brand guidelines page.</span></p>
<figure class="post__image" ><img loading="lazy" src="https://typogram.co/blog/media/posts/46/Print-Guidelines-as-PDF_lrg.gif" alt="brand guidelines pdf" width="1440" height="900">
<figcaption ><span style="font-weight: 400;">brand guidelines pdf</span></figcaption>
</figure>
<h1><span style="font-weight: 400;">Multi-Select Design Elements¬†</span></h1>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sometimes, you may want to implement the same design action on multiple parts of a logo ‚Äì for example, making a group of letters into a smaller font size or different font. Being able to select multiple objects makes this action easier.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now inside the logo editor, in addition to single-select, you can select multiple element by using the SHIFT key. Simply select the design element, press SHIFT, and make another selection to enable multi-select.</span></p>
<figure class="post__image" ><img loading="lazy" src="https://typogram.co/blog/media/posts/46/multi-select.gif" alt="multiple selections" width="1440" height="900">
<figcaption ><span style="font-weight: 400;">multiple selections</span></figcaption>
</figure>
<h1><span style="font-weight: 400;">An Update on Undo/Redo¬†</span></h1>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We have been working on Undo/Redo and this feature is now ready and shipped in the app. You can find Undo/Redo in the logo editor. Click on the right or left arrow to go back and forth between steps. We added an additional touch: hover over the clock icon and click on the numbers to return to a specific step in your design journey.</span></p>
<figure class="post__image" ><img loading="lazy" src="https://typogram.co/blog/media/posts/46/Undo-Redo.gif" alt="Undo/Redo in action inside the logo editor" width="1440" height="900">
<figcaption ><span style="font-weight: 400;">Undo/Redo in action inside the logo editor</span></figcaption>

<h1><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hearing from You</span></h1>

Please share them with us by directly replying to this email or filling out this </span><a href="https://tally.so/r/mVGEQv"><span style="font-weight: 400;">very short feedback form</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.
