Here is what we've working on this month!</p>\n<h2 class=\"header-with-anchor-widget\"><strong>Modularizing Brand Personality</strong></h2>\n<p>During our <a href=\"https://typogram.co/blog/typogram-product-updates-no12-in-app-tutorial-videos-streamlined-brand-name-change-modularized-app-components/\" title=\"typogram product update\">last product update</a>, we shared about our new product thinking: modular steps and shareable work-in-progress. We are making Typogram more modular, making workflow between steps more flexible, and design work more shareable. </p>\n<p>In the last few weeks, we have been working on modularizing the Brand Personality Step. I’ve been (Wenting) making two big changes to Typogram, starting with the brand personality step. </p>\n<h3 class=\"header-with-anchor-widget\"><strong>Changing the Base</strong></h3>\n<p>I initially built Typogram using a javascript framework called Vue. To improve the user experience, I changed the base of Typogram to Svelte. Svelte pre-renders our app and eliminates the need for loading additional JavaScript files, which our previous framework, Vue, lacked. This change will help our app run faster, improving the overall experience!</p>\n<h3 class=\"header-with-anchor-widget\"><strong>Making Parts &amp; Adding Share</strong></h3>\n<p>I’ve also been “modularizing” our app, splitting the app into smaller parts. Modularizing Typogram allows the potential for less linear workflows for users (a popular request ), makes things neater and easier to manage, and makes it possible to reuse the parts to create mini standalone apps for steps like Brand Personality. </p>\n<p>Here is a sneak peek of what I’ve added to the Brand Personality step – sharable social (Instagram) post that you can create and customize to share and test drive your designs immediately with your audience.</p>\n<div class=\"captioned-image-container\">\n<figure>\n<div class=\"image2-inset\"><picture><source type=\"image/webp\" srcset=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_lossy/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1a874421-2a25-44ad-aef5-0cd6431a6df8_538x593.gif 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_lossy/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1a874421-2a25-44ad-aef5-0cd6431a6df8_538x593.gif 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_lossy/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1a874421-2a25-44ad-aef5-0cd6431a6df8_538x593.gif 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_lossy/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1a874421-2a25-44ad-aef5-0cd6431a6df8_538x593.gif 1456w\" sizes=\"100vw\"></picture>\n<figure class=\"sizing-normal\" ><figure class=\"post__image\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  title=\"image: The sharable graphics can be customized with different color themes\" src=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_lossy/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1a874421-2a25-44ad-aef5-0cd6431a6df8_538x593.gif\" data-is-external-image=\"true\"  sizes=\"100vw\" srcset=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_lossy/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1a874421-2a25-44ad-aef5-0cd6431a6df8_538x593.gif 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_lossy/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1a874421-2a25-44ad-aef5-0cd6431a6df8_538x593.gif 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_lossy/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1a874421-2a25-44ad-aef5-0cd6431a6df8_538x593.gif 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_lossy/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1a874421-2a25-44ad-aef5-0cd6431a6df8_538x593.gif 1456w\" alt=\"image: The sharable graphics can be customized with different color themes\" width=\"930\" height=\"1037\" loading=\"lazy\" data-attrs=\"{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/1a874421-2a25-44ad-aef5-0cd6431a6df8_538x593.gif&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:593,&quot;width&quot;:538,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:&quot;image: The sharable graphics can be customized with different color themes&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null}\"></figure>\n<figcaption >image: The sharable graphics can be customized with different color themes</figcaption>\n</figure>\n</div>\n</figure>\n</div>\n<p>You can customize the colors of the post as well as the styles.

Don’t know how to start with fonts, color, and typography systems for your brand? Do not worry. We got you back! </p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Today we introduce one of our favorite tools we’ve created: <a href=\"https://workshop.typogram.co/\" title=\"Typogram’s Brand Personality Workshop Kit\">Typogram’s Brand Personality Workshop Kit</a>. Our branding workshop kit is made for folks with little to no marketing and branding design experience and is a fun activity that will help you start thinking creatively about your company. By following the three-step exercise in our free workshop kit, you will walk away with brand personalities and visual directions for your company, giving you ideas to build your brand designs: logos, fonts, colors, and typography systems.</p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What is brand personality? </span></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Inside Typogram, the first thing you complete is figuring out your brand personality. A brand is a person’s feeling about a product, a service, or a company. A brand personality is a “personality” or human characteristics we can assign to a brand. You can influence how people feel about your brand by creating a brand personality and then communicating the brand personality visually through the brand’s design directions, like fonts, logos, typography, colors, and imagery.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It can be overwhelming to start figuring out your brand personality, especially if you have no marketing background or have never thought about branding that way. Therefore, we created a fun, interactive workshop kit to help you identify your brand personality. </span></p>\n<figure class=\"post__image\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://typogram.co/blog/media/posts/50/brandPersonality.png\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" srcset=\"https://typogram.co/blog/media/posts/50/responsive/brandPersonality-xs.png 300w ,https://typogram.co/blog/media/posts/50/responsive/brandPersonality-sm.png 480w ,https://typogram.co/blog/media/posts/50/responsive/brandPersonality-md.png 768w ,https://typogram.co/blog/media/posts/50/responsive/brandPersonality-lg.png 1024w\"  alt=\"what is a brand \" width=\"1600\" height=\"900\"></figure>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What is inside our Brand Personality Workshop Kit?  </span></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This kit contains: </span></p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Explanation worksheets with interactive exercises help you understand and identify brand personality</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Custom brand personality cards with visual examples </span></li>\n</ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">By completing the three-step exercise in our workshop kit, you will learn, eliminate and finalize a chosen five top brand personalities, serving as visual directions and inspirations for your brand. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This workshop kit can accommodate a solopreneur or a small team of founders. It can be completed as a self-paced workshop or a collaborative team exercise. The exercise takes anywhere from 30 minutes to one hour, depending on the number of participants. We highly recommend you try this with your teammate or co-founder – it is a great team alignment exercise to start conversations about the visions for your business. As for file formats, the workshop is available in Google Slides, Notion, and PDF, so you may elect to complete this digitally or print it out on paper to get more hands-on. </span></p>\n<figure class=\"post__image\" ><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://typogram.co/blog/media/posts/50/brandPersonalityWorkshopPDF.gif\" alt=\"our brand personality workshop kit in PDF format  \" width=\"1200\" height=\"900\">\n<figcaption >our brand personality workshop kit in PDF format  </figcaption>\n</figure>\n<figure class=\"post__image\" ><img loading=\"lazy\" style=\"color: var(--text-primary-color); font-family: var(--editor-font-family); font-size: inherit; font-weight: var(--font-weight-normal);\" src=\"https://typogram.co/blog/media/posts/50/slider-digital-pic1-2x.png\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" srcset=\"https://typogram.co/blog/media/posts/50/responsive/slider-digital-pic1-2x-xs.png 300w ,https://typogram.co/blog/media/posts/50/responsive/slider-digital-pic1-2x-sm.png 480w ,https://typogram.co/blog/media/posts/50/responsive/slider-digital-pic1-2x-md.png 768w ,https://typogram.co/blog/media/posts/50/responsive/slider-digital-pic1-2x-lg.png 1024w\"  alt=\"our brand personality workshop kit inside Google slides\" width=\"1440\" height=\"1500\">\n<figcaption >our brand personality workshop kit inside Google slides</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<hr>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">How did we develop this kit? </span></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Our brand personality workshop kit originated and evolved from Typogram’s product development process. Initially, we wanted to identify a user experience flow for the brand personality feature inside the Typogram app: how can we make the brand personality a valuable feature to the users? What specific interactions can we include at this step, and what do they look like? </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With many hypotheses, we focused on shipping quickly for testing. We created this workshop using three popular No-Code tools easily accessible to our potential users: PDF, Google Slides, and Notion. Now that we have sped up the product development process using No-Code, we can focus on testing and making the UX as rewarding as possible. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The end product featured a main flow: users sort through different cards of brand personality and each time, they sort and choose using various methods: First, they identify based on a list of words and then narrow down based on images. Ultimately, users land on five words as visual themes/directions for their logos. Observing from our user testing session that branding is a starting point for conversation - we designed the workshop to work for solopreneurs or a team. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We organized user testing sessions and received great feedback. The success of user testing validated the flow and design of our brand personality feature inside Typogram! Because of the overwhelmingly positive response, we now make this kit a free resource for our community. </span></p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Access our Brand Personality Workshop Kit</span></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You can download our free </span><a href=\"https://workshop.typogram.co/\" title=\"Typogram's Brand Personality Workshop Kit\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Brand Personality Workshop Kit</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> on our website.

Because Typogram offers a one-brand lifetime license, you are locked down to a brand name once you purchase a paid license. However, we understand that sometimes, accidents happen. There can be spelling errors or incorrect name entries.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The old process for the brand name change was manually sending us an email or via the chat widget. Starting today, we have a better, more streamlined process: you can initiate a name change directly in the app through your project dashboard. Under the appropriate project, click “Request Change Brand Name,” to enter a new name for approval. It’ll usually approve within 24 hours.</span></p>\n<figure class=\"post__image\" ><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://typogram.co/blog/media/posts/49/brandNameChangeEditUpdate_2-2.gif\" alt=\"img: request to change brand name\" width=\"1440\" height=\"900\">\n<figcaption ><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">img: Request to change brand name</span></figcaption>\n</figure>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Upcoming: Modularized App Components &amp; Expanding Brand Personality Workshop</span></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We are currently reworking our app from the ground up with a brand-new direction to product thinking: </span><strong>modular steps and shareable work-in-progress.</strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> We take pride in our unique eight-step process for creating a professional brand, but its implementation in the app seems rigid regarding workflow adherence. You must go through a series of steps to reach the final destination—Brand Guidelines—which is the only place and time where you can share your work.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The new Typogram maintains the same brand design philosophies and workflows but is much more modular and flexible. We broke ground on this new app direction with Typogram’s first step—Brand Personality. Once completed, it will function as a modular component that can either stand alone as a mini app or serve as a segue to the full Typogram experience. The Brand Personality app will also feature a more visually stunning presentation you can save and publish. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Our plans for the future: every single step is a standalone app, much more robust, but at the same time, it is still part of the full Typogram experience. The brand design journey can start anywhere and in any order. The work product of each step is presented in a much more visually-impressive way, and you can save and share with your team or community to get feedback.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Let us know what you think of this future direction!</span></p>\n<h1> </h1>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Hearing from You</span></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We’d love to hear more of your thoughts if you have already tried the software.

There were a variety of reasons for this, which I will expand on later. Despite this setback, we still launched our product with the support of our community and gained new users, both free and paid! We’re still proud of what we accomplished and are grateful for the support we received.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br></span></p>\n<h2>We fell through a crack on Product Hunt</h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Product Hunt, the popular platform for discovering new and innovative products, has its fair share of quirks. One such quirk is the potential to fall through the cracks and not get featured on the front page.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What products get featured on the front page and why? From Product Hunt’s response to our complaint, it seems that manual curation plays a substantial role in their selection process:</span></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I very much regret the experience. We try our best to feature everything that is eligible and that we think will be a value add to our community. Every now and then, unfortunately, we do miss a great launch. — Product Hunt Support</span></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I think that the Product Hunt team must employ a combination of strategies to manage this workload efficiently. It seems implausible for a manual process alone to handle such a volume, making me question how they strike the right balance between human curation and algorithmic assistance. Whatever they do, mistakes happen, which is unfortunately on our part.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The “falling into Product Hunt crack” actually happens much more often than I realized. Just today, I observed another company that suffered the same fate as Typogram last Tuesday.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Look at the diagram from </span><a href=\"https://hunted.space/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">hunted.space</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, a site that collects Product Hunt launch statistics and analyzes trends. On the launch day of Typogram, for the first four hours, Hunted Space couldn’t find Typogram and therefore didn’t crawl any stats, reporting a flat line for 0 votes until it jumped to 40 votes suddenly:</span></p>\n<figure class=\"post__image\" ><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://typogram.co/blog/media/posts/44/eb51025a-c194-48ab-8e37-b15761b9e762_980x385.jpg\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" srcset=\"https://typogram.co/blog/media/posts/44/responsive/eb51025a-c194-48ab-8e37-b15761b9e762_980x385-xs.jpg 300w ,https://typogram.co/blog/media/posts/44/responsive/eb51025a-c194-48ab-8e37-b15761b9e762_980x385-sm.jpg 480w ,https://typogram.co/blog/media/posts/44/responsive/eb51025a-c194-48ab-8e37-b15761b9e762_980x385-md.jpg 768w ,https://typogram.co/blog/media/posts/44/responsive/eb51025a-c194-48ab-8e37-b15761b9e762_980x385-lg.jpg 1024w\"  alt=\"Comparing Typogram to the product that secured the 2nd position.

It also has a flat line in the beginning section.</span></figcaption>\n</figure>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The flat line in the beginning doesn’t mean the product didn’t get votes during those times. It just means that they got no exposure that the stats crawler didn’t crawl. </span></i></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">During this time, Typogram is live on Product Hunt, but people only find it through the link we shared. In other words, we are sending traffic to Product Hunt, not the other way around. The moment we get unburied at hour 4, we already got 40 votes, purely from our own people! That is a miracle in itself! </span></p>\n<h2>How Launching on Product Hunt Works</h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We ask our community to visit Product Hunt and upvote our product, which in turn boosts our ranking. As our position improves, we attract more traffic from Product Hunt’s user base. Ideally, a successful launch results in significantly more traffic flowing from Product Hunt to our product than what we initially directed toward them. Unfortunately, it may not be the case for our launch this time.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When we finally got unburied, we had 40 votes and ranked #13. Ranking in #13 means we only get the exposure and traffic that belongs to #13, which is less than #12, which is less than #11 … you get my point. Assuming all products are equally interesting and have the same upvote ratio (the number of votes divided by the number of visitors), our vote gap is only getting larger and larger by default.</span></p>\n<p><strong>In order to climb up, we need to:</strong></p>\n<ol>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><strong>be more interesting so that the upvote ratio is higher</strong></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><strong>lead more outside traffic to your Product Hunt post</strong></li>\n</ol>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The #1 is done prior; nothing we can change on the launch day. I think our product is very unique and interesting. We trend up really quickly after we get onto the front page, thanks to that.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The #2 is counter-intuitive. We launch on Product Hunt to get more people to visit us, not the other way around. But in order to get more exposure, we have to send more traffic first. We continue to ask our community to show up and support us, and you all did. We climbed all the way from #13 to #5 in the early afternoon!</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Each position on Product Hunt corresponds to a certain level of traffic. To optimize your launch, it’s crucial to secure a top position as early as possible.</span></p>\n<p><strong>The traffic generated during a launch is determined by two factors:</strong></p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong> Your position on Product Hunt</strong></li>\n<li><strong> The duration you maintain that position</strong></li>\n</ol>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Even if some product manages to climb from the bottom to the top #1 spot at the last minute and earn the “Product of the Day” title, it won’t make a significant impact, as it would only benefit from one minute of the top position’s traffic. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We enjoyed about half a day of position #5’s traffic, and the other half day we get very little traffic.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The launch experience serves as a reminder of the importance of building our own audience. While leveraging platforms like Product Hunt can be beneficial, their outcomes are not always reliable. I was confident that our launch would secure the top #1 or #2 spot, especially since I had previously achieved #2 with a hobby project, Symbols to Copy. In comparison, Typogram is a much more interesting and robust product. Nonetheless, this experience underscores the need to focus on cultivating a community of user base independently.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Our community carried us through the launch. Without their support, we could have easily been buried throughout the entire day. Instead, we managed to emerge as #13 and continued to climb the ranks, demonstrating the power of an engaged community in driving a product’s growth.</span></p>\n<h2>Launch Stats</h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On launch day, we coincidentally acquired exactly 100 new users, and with additional sign-ups in the following week, we reached a total of 230 new users. Among these, 9 converted to paid users, resulting in a conversion rate of approximately 4%.</span></p>\n<figure class=\"post__image--wide\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://typogram.co/blog/media/posts/44/51c6586b-c80c-4083-89b8-c74fc800a3c2_720x402.png\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" srcset=\"https://typogram.co/blog/media/posts/44/responsive/51c6586b-c80c-4083-89b8-c74fc800a3c2_720x402-xs.png 300w ,https://typogram.co/blog/media/posts/44/responsive/51c6586b-c80c-4083-89b8-c74fc800a3c2_720x402-sm.png 480w ,https://typogram.co/blog/media/posts/44/responsive/51c6586b-c80c-4083-89b8-c74fc800a3c2_720x402-md.png 768w ,https://typogram.co/blog/media/posts/44/responsive/51c6586b-c80c-4083-89b8-c74fc800a3c2_720x402-lg.png 1024w\"  alt=\"\" width=\"720\" height=\"402\"></figure>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Despite feeling as though we were deprived of the #1 position, it's important to remember that a launch is not a sprint but a marathon. In the grand scheme of things, a year from now, this minor setback won't even matter the slightest. If someone is meant to become our user, we will undoubtedly cross paths with them eventually — we just have to keep going to meet them. </span></p>",

Once the brand project is created, users can’t edit the brand name independently and must contact us. A few users requested a brand name change to explore capitalizing certain letters in their logo. This limitation is not what I intended — locking the brand name shouldn’t prevent users from switching the letter case. So I immediately started designing and implementing this feature. This feature is available in this app right now!</p>\n<figure class=\"post__image\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/ZA71yxgxQ59XQ0jcCugCd0o2dzQWICX7-ViWm7O0XBN3uNOxeo0T7BYSDDDBrcyeb3UrSJn_1AHtQs9-uJV2sc5WKd3FKJx4IS10PTaioTDR5_jK6qkMfMgUa8E44L3d-o2pVDxzkZXlcuIWu2EqLWk\" data-is-external-image=\"true\"  alt=\"caseSwitch\"><figcaption>Switch letter case</figcaption></figure>\n<h1> </h1>\n<h1 id=\"new-feature-2-tool-tips\">New Feature No.2: Tool Tips</h1>\n<p>Another feedback I received was about progression. Users often have to perform specific actions inside our app before the “Continue” button appears, allowing them to progress to the next step. It is not uncommon for users to get confused about how to move forward before the “Continue” button appears for the first time.

For example, “h” is a lowercase letter with an ascender. In general, typefaces having long ascenders and descenders help with readability. Long ascenders help make a lowercase more distinguishable as long as the other parts of the letters are legible.</span></p>\n<figure class=\"post__image\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://typogram.co/blog/media/posts/40/ascender-3.png\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" srcset=\"https://typogram.co/blog/media/posts/40/responsive/ascender-3-xs.png 300w ,https://typogram.co/blog/media/posts/40/responsive/ascender-3-sm.png 480w ,https://typogram.co/blog/media/posts/40/responsive/ascender-3-md.png 768w ,https://typogram.co/blog/media/posts/40/responsive/ascender-3-lg.png 1024w\"  alt=\"Ascender\" width=\"1200\" height=\"630\"></figure>\n<h1> </h1>\n<h1><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Baseline</span><a id=\"Baseline\"></a></h1>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The baseline is the horizon line (sometimes invisible) on which the letters sit. In most typefaces, curved letters, like “O,” “e,” and “s,” sit slightly below the baseline to create optical balance and alignment with other letters. Letters with descenders like “p” and “q” extend below the baseline.</span></p>\n<figure class=\"post__image\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://typogram.co/blog/media/posts/40/baseline-3.png\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" srcset=\"https://typogram.co/blog/media/posts/40/responsive/baseline-3-xs.png 300w ,https://typogram.co/blog/media/posts/40/responsive/baseline-3-sm.png 480w ,https://typogram.co/blog/media/posts/40/responsive/baseline-3-md.png 768w ,https://typogram.co/blog/media/posts/40/responsive/baseline-3-lg.png 1024w\"  alt=\"Baseline\" width=\"1200\" height=\"630\"></figure>\n<h1> </h1>\n<h1><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Bracket</span><a id=\"Bracket\"></a></h1>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A bracket is a curved or wedge-like area connecting a serif and a stroke. This curve area can be large or small. Typefaces with large areas of curves are said to have large bracketing. Those with small curved areas have small bracketing. Some serif typefaces have no bracketing. </span></p>\n<figure class=\"post__image\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://typogram.co/blog/media/posts/40/bracket-2.png\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" srcset=\"https://typogram.co/blog/media/posts/40/responsive/bracket-2-xs.png 300w ,https://typogram.co/blog/media/posts/40/responsive/bracket-2-sm.png 480w ,https://typogram.co/blog/media/posts/40/responsive/bracket-2-md.png 768w ,https://typogram.co/blog/media/posts/40/responsive/bracket-2-lg.png 1024w\"  alt=\"Bracket\" width=\"1200\" height=\"630\"></figure>\n<h1> </h1>\n<h1><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Cap Height</span><a id=\"CapHeight\"></a></h1>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Cap Height is the height of a capital letter, measured from the baseline to flat capitals like “H.” Letters like “S” and “O,” have a slight overshoot over the cap height. This is done so that curve-topped letters like “S” or “O” look optically aligned and balanced with flat-topped letters like “H.”</span></p>\n<figure class=\"post__image\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://typogram.co/blog/media/posts/40/cap-height-3.png\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" srcset=\"https://typogram.co/blog/media/posts/40/responsive/cap-height-3-xs.png 300w ,https://typogram.co/blog/media/posts/40/responsive/cap-height-3-sm.png 480w ,https://typogram.co/blog/media/posts/40/responsive/cap-height-3-md.png 768w ,https://typogram.co/blog/media/posts/40/responsive/cap-height-3-lg.png 1024w\"  alt=\"Cap Height\" width=\"1200\" height=\"630\"></figure>\n<h1> </h1>\n<h1><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Counter</span><a id=\"Counter\"></a></h1>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A counter is an unfilled (white or negative) space partially or entirely closed by other parts of the letters. For example, lowercase “b” and uppercase “U” both have counters. The stroke creating a counter shape is known as a “bowl.” There are two types of counter spaces: open and closed. An <strong>open counter</strong> means the unfilled space is partially closed, like “U.” A <strong>closed counter</strong> happens when the unfilled space is completely sealed, like “b.” </span></p>\n<figure class=\"post__image\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://typogram.co/blog/media/posts/40/counter.png\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" srcset=\"https://typogram.co/blog/media/posts/40/responsive/counter-xs.png 300w ,https://typogram.co/blog/media/posts/40/responsive/counter-sm.png 480w ,https://typogram.co/blog/media/posts/40/responsive/counter-md.png 768w ,https://typogram.co/blog/media/posts/40/responsive/counter-lg.png 1024w\"  alt=\"Counter\" width=\"1200\" height=\"630\"></figure>\n<h1> </h1>\n<h1><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Descender</span><a id=\"Descender\"></a></h1>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A descender is a vertical stroke of a lowercase letter extending below the baseline. For example, “p” is a lowercase letter with a descender. Like ascenders, long descenders make lowercase letters more distinguishable, improving readability.  </span></p>\n<figure class=\"post__image\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://typogram.co/blog/media/posts/40/descender-2.png\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" srcset=\"https://typogram.co/blog/media/posts/40/responsive/descender-2-xs.png 300w ,https://typogram.co/blog/media/posts/40/responsive/descender-2-sm.png 480w ,https://typogram.co/blog/media/posts/40/responsive/descender-2-md.png 768w ,https://typogram.co/blog/media/posts/40/responsive/descender-2-lg.png 1024w\"  alt=\"Descender\" width=\"1200\" height=\"630\"></figure>\n<h1> </h1>\n<h1><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Terminal</span><a id=\"Terminal\"></a></h1>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A Terminal is an end of a straight or curved stroke without serifs. The terminal can be a place where a typeface showcases its stylistic elements. For example, in some letters, like “a,” there can be a droplet shape at the end of a stroke. This is called a ball terminal. </span></p>\n<figure class=\"post__image\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://typogram.co/blog/media/posts/40/ball-terminal.png\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" srcset=\"https://typogram.co/blog/media/posts/40/responsive/ball-terminal-xs.png 300w ,https://typogram.co/blog/media/posts/40/responsive/ball-terminal-sm.png 480w ,https://typogram.co/blog/media/posts/40/responsive/ball-terminal-md.png 768w ,https://typogram.co/blog/media/posts/40/responsive/ball-terminal-lg.png 1024w\"  alt=\"Terminal\" width=\"1200\" height=\"630\"></figure>\n<h1> </h1>\n<h1><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">x-Height</span><a id=\"x-Height\"></a></h1>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The term x-height describes the distance from the baseline to the top of a flat-topped lowercase letter, like the lowercase “x.” x-height is a stylistic choice and varies for different typefaces. However, x-height also is a factor in readability. As the x-height increase, the length of ascenders and descenders usually decreases. This causes the letters to become less readable.</span></p>\n<figure class=\"post__image\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://typogram.co/blog/media/posts/40/x-height-2.png\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" srcset=\"https://typogram.co/blog/media/posts/40/responsive/x-height-2-xs.png 300w ,https://typogram.co/blog/media/posts/40/responsive/x-height-2-sm.png 480w ,https://typogram.co/blog/media/posts/40/responsive/x-height-2-md.png 768w ,https://typogram.co/blog/media/posts/40/responsive/x-height-2-lg.png 1024w\"  alt=\"x-Height\" width=\"1200\" height=\"630\"></figure>\n<figure class=\"post__image\" ><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://typogram.co/blog/media/posts/40/typedetails.png\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" srcset=\"https://typogram.co/blog/media/posts/40/responsive/typedetails-xs.png 300w ,https://typogram.co/blog/media/posts/40/responsive/typedetails-sm.png 480w ,https://typogram.co/blog/media/posts/40/responsive/typedetails-md.png 768w ,https://typogram.co/blog/media/posts/40/responsive/typedetails-lg.png 1024w\"  alt=\"type details\" width=\"1680\" height=\"630\">\n<figcaption >Infographic summing up type detail terms</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>Want more Typography Jargon Buster?</strong> Check out <a href=\"https://typogram.co/blog/essential-terms-you-must-know-about-typography/\"><em>Essential Typography Terms</em></a>, <em><a href=\"https://typogram.co/blog/common-styles-of-serif-fonts-you-must-know-to-improve-your-design/\">Serif</a></em>, and <em><a href=\"https://typogram.co/blog/different-types-of-sans-serifs/\">Sans Serifs Classifications You Must Know.</a></em></span></p>",
