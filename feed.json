We realize PH launches can be a vehicle instead of a single event. Instead of considering the PH launch as the solitary main event, we could see it as the culminating event. That way, we can grow and build hype around the product in multiple ways.</p>\n<div class=\"pullquote\">\n<p>You can <a href=\"https://www.producthunt.com/products/typogram\">follow</a> our actions here! 🚀</p>\n</div>\n<p><strong>So, we are trying a new experiment. </strong></p>\n<h3 class=\"header-with-anchor-widget\">First Three Weeks</h3>\n<p>Rather than promoting intensely for two weeks right before and concentrating solely on the launch event, we have been promoting the whole month, with the first three weeks centered on broadening our reach. We created a content bank from our previous blog posts and newsletter issues. We then crafted tweets, posts, and graphics and scheduled them on our Twitter accounts. We are focusing on: </p>\n<ul>\n<li>Grow subscribers for our build-in-public newsletter <br><br></li>\n<li>Gain free account users and increase exposure to Typogram<br><br></li>\n<li>Increase our Twitter audience before the launch to maximize reach</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 class=\"header-with-anchor-widget\">Final Week</h3>\n<p>In the final week, we’ll focus more intensely on Product Hunt, utilizing methods we learned from previous launches. </p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Gather the support of our friends from different time zones </p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Get active on product hunt community forums </p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Mystery launch photoshoot (this is something fun we are doing- can’t wait to share with you more)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Launch exclusive post with call the action to PH launch soon page </p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 class=\"header-with-anchor-widget\">How is it going?</h3>\n<p>We are in the third week, and We’ve been scheduling and posting tweets. So far, it’s working great. I've been getting more active on Twitter, and now working on Reddit. Next week, I'll start doing more behind-the-scenes work exclusively for the launch. </p>\n<p> </p>",

We’ve made countless improvements and bug fixes. A few major ones: </p>\n<h4>Improving Overall User Experience</h4>\n<p>This overhaul was not merely a switch but a journey where we painstakingly crushed reported bugs, resolved technical debt, and discovered more efficient ways to execute, all aimed at enhancing the quality of Typogram for our users. Our new app, now optimized for performance and rendering, effectively addressed and resolved many previous issues, such as font loading and rendering.</p>\n<h4>Complete Rework of Redo-Undo Feature</h4>\n<p>We completely rebuilt this feature and fixed the “ghost artboard flashback” issue. Also, by switching the data storage method, the feature can now handle a much longer edit history, allowing you to go way back in artboard history if you ever find regrets in your design journey.</p>\n<h4>Brand New Login Page</h4>\n<p>Our new modular code base has significantly enhanced our development process, enabling us to add new features more easily and quickly. </p>\n<p>Previously, we used a pre-packaged login page, which occasionally had users stuck in an infinite login loop. We didn’t have control over this external code to fix the bug. With our new custom login page, we have now resolved the issue. It is more reliable, beautiful, and has nice user experience details. </p>\n<div class=\"captioned-image-container\">\n<figure>\n<div class=\"image2-inset\"><picture><source type=\"image/webp\" srcset=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_lossy/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ffaafd2b7-63b6-41f6-a236-f779cff1e65d_1440x900.gif 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_lossy/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ffaafd2b7-63b6-41f6-a236-f779cff1e65d_1440x900.gif 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_lossy/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ffaafd2b7-63b6-41f6-a236-f779cff1e65d_1440x900.gif 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_lossy/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ffaafd2b7-63b6-41f6-a236-f779cff1e65d_1440x900.gif 1456w\" sizes=\"100vw\"></picture>\n<figure class=\"sizing-normal\" ><figure class=\"post__image\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_lossy/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ffaafd2b7-63b6-41f6-a236-f779cff1e65d_1440x900.gif\" data-is-external-image=\"true\"  sizes=\"100vw\" srcset=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_lossy/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ffaafd2b7-63b6-41f6-a236-f779cff1e65d_1440x900.gif 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_lossy/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ffaafd2b7-63b6-41f6-a236-f779cff1e65d_1440x900.gif 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_lossy/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ffaafd2b7-63b6-41f6-a236-f779cff1e65d_1440x900.gif 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_lossy/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ffaafd2b7-63b6-41f6-a236-f779cff1e65d_1440x900.gif 1456w\" alt=\"Gif: Auto-direct to Sign Up or Sign In based on your account status\" width=\"1440\" height=\"900\" data-attrs=\"{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/faafd2b7-63b6-41f6-a236-f779cff1e65d_1440x900.gif&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:900,&quot;width&quot;:1440,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:&quot;https://typogram.co/sign-in&quot;,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:false,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null}\"></figure>\n<figcaption ><em>Gif: Auto-direct to Sign Up or Sign In based on your account status</em></figcaption>\n</figure>\n</div>\n<figcaption class=\"image-caption\"></figcaption>\n</figure>\n</div>\n<h4>Better Free Plan</h4>\n<p>Another major update: We are making Typogram easier to try and recommend.

Once you are used to the user interface, the editor is intuitive and allows you to create automation flows between different apps. I use Make to set up part of the payment system for Typogram.

We offered a discounted lifetime deal for a single-brand license for this pre-order. Users can edit their logo forever inside our app as long as it's for the same brand. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At this point, we have yet to complete coding for the entire tool, like account management and payment. We wanted to gauge the interest first with our current set of features. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On the landing page, we had a demo video of our features, made using Webflow, which we still use for our product (if you go to our landing page now, you can still see the video). We also collected testimonials from our user testing sessions to feature on the landing page as social proofs. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We launched this on Product Hunt and in the channels we've been developing (our newsletters) and got about 16 paid customers and 1,500 site visits in the first two weeks. Here is a </span><a href=\"https://typogram.co/blog/what-we-learned-from-launching-our-startup-on-product-hunt/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">detailed post</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> if you wish to see the stats from that launch. </span></p>\n<figure class=\"post__image\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/Q5UlwGCljMprpu1PBExVcI7tb7X5VQgE1ZuTSY2Vt1uiuzcMkEQWQO6GjMR9quexxwbqEg-wJTx9mJgN2yqKmZVKSxXHZ4AmlC_qmCrV5Fju0mMVLXUgxCNdStOtTfB29MaOqD2ZuUpi_u1XrO3nVQ4\" data-is-external-image=\"true\"  alt=\"our product hunt launch\"><figcaption>Our product hunt launch for Typogram's pre-order</figcaption></figure>\n<hr>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Short Term: Growth &amp; Traction </span></h2>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Find Your First 10 Customers and First 100 Registered Users </span></h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Build it, and they will come, right?

We have been successful with content marketing and Engineering as marketing for growth. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Write content your potential new users will like. You can find topics for these by either interviewing them or searching on communities like Quora or Reddit. Then, find a platform where your users live and share your content consistently. </span></p>\n<figure class=\"post__image\" ><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://typogram.co/blog/media/posts/53/FontDiscovery-research.png\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" srcset=\"https://typogram.co/blog/media/posts/53/responsive/FontDiscovery-research-xs.png 300w ,https://typogram.co/blog/media/posts/53/responsive/FontDiscovery-research-sm.png 480w ,https://typogram.co/blog/media/posts/53/responsive/FontDiscovery-research-md.png 768w ,https://typogram.co/blog/media/posts/53/responsive/FontDiscovery-research-lg.png 1024w\"  alt=\"our research for our design content\" width=\"1400\" height=\"700\">\n<figcaption >Our research for our design content</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<h4><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Newsletter </span></h4>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I wish someone told me sooner about newsletters - the great thing about them is that you can start one even if you don't have a product. I highly recommend this strategy because you are not tied to the platform, and you can start creating a community and finding supporters immediately.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Typogram has two weekly newsletters: a </span><a href=\"https://build.typogram.co/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">built-in public newsletter</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> about our startup journey and </span><a href=\"https://fontdiscovery.typogram.co/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">a design newsletter</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, sharing beginner-friendly tips for typography, branding, and logo design. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In our newsletters, we share our startup journey. We also find topics to write about by researching what our users are interested in through Reddit. Initially, I was worried I couldn't maintain the consistency required for newsletters. Most days, it was easy to come up with topics to write about. Writing to an audience also helped me stay motivated. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Strategies for growing the newsletters include sharing on relevant communities, like Reddit, Indiehackers, and Twitter, and cross-promotion with other newsletters.</span></p>\n<h4><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Reddit</span></h4>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Reddit is an excellent place filled with communities of all sorts of interests. A proud Redditor since 2010s, Reddit is my preferred platform. Redditors hate spamming, and mods can permanently ban you from the site if you break the rules of their communities. In most subreddits, you will find rules on the right-hand side specifying community rules. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The most efficient way to market on Reddit is to ask for feedback about my project and focus on being helpful. Another useful technique is to filter posts by \"Hot\" and look at what topics people have written about that the followers of the subreddits already liked. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You can then use these as prompts to create your content and posts. Lastly, you can be helpful in the comments and subtly plug your products. Comments are less moderated. </span></p>\n<h4><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Power-up: F5Bot</span></h4>\n<p><a href=\"https://f5bot.com/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">F5Bot</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> is a fantastic, free resource that helps you level up your Reddit game by allowing you to track keywords on those platforms. You will get posts with targeted keywords delivered to your inbox. I primarily use this tool to understand and engage with my potential users in the startup communities.</span></p>\n<h4><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Secret Hack</span></h4>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It is possible to become a moderator of an abandoned subreddit. Many subreddits (anywhere from under 100 to over 10k in size) have inactive moderators. If you have enough karma points, you can apply to be a mod for inactive communities. Though you will have to perform extra labor of monitoring content, it could be very effective if it's in your niche.</span></p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Engineering as Marketing </span></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Engineering as Marketing can be more costly than other growth tactics in the short term, utilizing more time and effort in a concentrated block of time. However, if your engineering as marketing project takes off, you get a great new digital real estate, a nice traffic boost, and even SEO benefits. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For example, we launched </span><a href=\"https://codingfont.com/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Coding Font</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> as an Engineering as Marketing project for Typogram. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Because many potential users for Typogram are web devs and people who spent a lot of time in IDE, we wanted to create a fun little website where they could find their dream coding font. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When we launched Coding Font on Product Hunt, we got </span><a href=\"https://build.typogram.co/p/stats-of-coding-font-launch\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">​​22,000 visits on launch day</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. Coding Font was featured on the front page of Hackernews and on blogs like <a href=\"https://boingboing.net/2021/10/27/click-your-way-to-your-favorite-monospace-font.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">BoingBoing</a> and <a href=\"https://css-tricks.com/coding-font-game/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">CSS Tricks</a>, improving its backlink profile and site ranking. We seized this opportunity to add blog content and keywords to this site. As a result, we got newsletter sign-ups, sales, and continuous referral traffic. </span></p>\n<figure class=\"post__image\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/4HCXr-QG3213ko9g6RkGap8KZiuSWeAmolfxeDYRjEXnk4iFzvyW1GlKM8FmodSo4-LwbQvcmHJEJVqjfBaQ5LC2pugQNTAGE8sXrVHqJgRgx2o24GtlcYepXI6eC7Fk2OuIFQZuNCz6lpvL-AfATu4\" data-is-external-image=\"true\"  alt=\"Our most successful engineering as marketing game, Coding Font\"><figcaption>Our most successful engineering as marketing game, Coding Font</figcaption></figure>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Long-Term Growth: </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">SEO/Organic Traffic via Long-Tail Keywords </span></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">SEO gets a bad rep from email spam by link-building agencies, but it's one of the best ways to </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">gain free traffic and attract potential users to your site. The most important thing about SEO: it takes time to develop and grow. Once we validated ideas for Typogram, we started paying closer attention to SEO and how we can leverage SEO to increase organic traffic. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You can target long tail keywords, which are three to five words long search queries. Long tails are usually more niche, less search volume, and less competitive. For example, we have the </span><a href=\"https://typogram.co/font-discovery\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">FontDiscovery(our design newsletter) archive</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> for Typogram for our long tail search queries. These posts give us a nice traffic boost, over 1k per month. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I highly recommend Ahrefs' YouTube lessons. Please force yourself to watch them. You won't regret it, and you might even like it.</span></p>\n<figure class=\"post__image\" ><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://typogram.co/blog/media/posts/53/Font-Discovery-Blog.png\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" srcset=\"https://typogram.co/blog/media/posts/53/responsive/Font-Discovery-Blog-xs.png 300w ,https://typogram.co/blog/media/posts/53/responsive/Font-Discovery-Blog-sm.png 480w ,https://typogram.co/blog/media/posts/53/responsive/Font-Discovery-Blog-md.png 768w ,https://typogram.co/blog/media/posts/53/responsive/Font-Discovery-Blog-lg.png 1024w\"  alt=\"FontDiscovery archive \" width=\"1600\" height=\"1060\">\n<figcaption >FontDiscovery archive </figcaption>\n</figure>\n<figure class=\"post__image\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/0oEpakJ6_ybu613hMTE9vv9Q7Ul38vt8Zxi_3G4C6ImgzWDxWvO9uGMKNmRpumCRNnXfHHJoBQDAKViQRZtXVum9eotgwRLUAyLGV2mEuDqWFejS3o_0xSld9h5Cv3zWtuv_rGM9dFrF_mHUlyi_O4A\" data-is-external-image=\"true\"  alt=\"Some promising results from long tail keywords\"><figcaption>Promising results from long tail keywords</figcaption></figure>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Last Words </span></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">My last words are about ads.

Here is what we've working on this month!</p>\n<h2 class=\"header-with-anchor-widget\"><strong>Modularizing Brand Personality</strong></h2>\n<p>During our <a href=\"https://typogram.co/blog/typogram-product-updates-no12-in-app-tutorial-videos-streamlined-brand-name-change-modularized-app-components/\" title=\"typogram product update\">last product update</a>, we shared about our new product thinking: modular steps and shareable work-in-progress. We are making Typogram more modular, making workflow between steps more flexible, and design work more shareable. </p>\n<p>In the last few weeks, we have been working on modularizing the Brand Personality Step. I’ve been (Wenting) making two big changes to Typogram, starting with the brand personality step. </p>\n<h3 class=\"header-with-anchor-widget\"><strong>Changing the Base</strong></h3>\n<p>I initially built Typogram using a javascript framework called Vue. To improve the user experience, I changed the base of Typogram to Svelte. Svelte pre-renders our app and eliminates the need for loading additional JavaScript files, which our previous framework, Vue, lacked. This change will help our app run faster, improving the overall experience!</p>\n<h3 class=\"header-with-anchor-widget\"><strong>Making Parts &amp; Adding Share</strong></h3>\n<p>I’ve also been “modularizing” our app, splitting the app into smaller parts. Modularizing Typogram allows the potential for less linear workflows for users (a popular request ), makes things neater and easier to manage, and makes it possible to reuse the parts to create mini standalone apps for steps like Brand Personality. </p>\n<p>Here is a sneak peek of what I’ve added to the Brand Personality step – sharable social (Instagram) post that you can create and customize to share and test drive your designs immediately with your audience.</p>\n<div class=\"captioned-image-container\">\n<figure>\n<div class=\"image2-inset\"><picture><source type=\"image/webp\" srcset=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_lossy/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1a874421-2a25-44ad-aef5-0cd6431a6df8_538x593.gif 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_lossy/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1a874421-2a25-44ad-aef5-0cd6431a6df8_538x593.gif 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_lossy/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1a874421-2a25-44ad-aef5-0cd6431a6df8_538x593.gif 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_lossy/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1a874421-2a25-44ad-aef5-0cd6431a6df8_538x593.gif 1456w\" sizes=\"100vw\"></picture>\n<figure class=\"sizing-normal\" ><figure class=\"post__image\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  title=\"image: The sharable graphics can be customized with different color themes\" src=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_lossy/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1a874421-2a25-44ad-aef5-0cd6431a6df8_538x593.gif\" data-is-external-image=\"true\"  sizes=\"100vw\" srcset=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_lossy/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1a874421-2a25-44ad-aef5-0cd6431a6df8_538x593.gif 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_lossy/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1a874421-2a25-44ad-aef5-0cd6431a6df8_538x593.gif 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_lossy/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1a874421-2a25-44ad-aef5-0cd6431a6df8_538x593.gif 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_lossy/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1a874421-2a25-44ad-aef5-0cd6431a6df8_538x593.gif 1456w\" alt=\"image: The sharable graphics can be customized with different color themes\" width=\"930\" height=\"1037\" loading=\"lazy\" data-attrs=\"{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/1a874421-2a25-44ad-aef5-0cd6431a6df8_538x593.gif&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:593,&quot;width&quot;:538,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:&quot;image: The sharable graphics can be customized with different color themes&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null}\"></figure>\n<figcaption >image: The sharable graphics can be customized with different color themes</figcaption>\n</figure>\n</div>\n</figure>\n</div>\n<p>You can customize the colors of the post as well as the styles.

Don’t know how to start with fonts, color, and typography systems for your brand? Do not worry.

Our branding workshop kit is made for folks with little to no marketing and branding design experience and is a fun activity that will help you start thinking creatively about your company. By following the three-step exercise in our free workshop kit, you will walk away with brand personalities and visual directions for your company, giving you ideas to build your brand designs: logos, fonts, colors, and typography systems.</p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What is brand personality? </span></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Inside Typogram, the first thing you complete is figuring out your brand personality. A brand is a person’s feeling about a product, a service, or a company. A brand personality is a “personality” or human characteristics we can assign to a brand. You can influence how people feel about your brand by creating a brand personality and then communicating the brand personality visually through the brand’s design directions, like fonts, logos, typography, colors, and imagery.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It can be overwhelming to start figuring out your brand personality, especially if you have no marketing background or have never thought about branding that way. Therefore, we created a fun, interactive workshop kit to help you identify your brand personality. </span></p>\n<figure class=\"post__image\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://typogram.co/blog/media/posts/50/brandPersonality.png\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" srcset=\"https://typogram.co/blog/media/posts/50/responsive/brandPersonality-xs.png 300w ,https://typogram.co/blog/media/posts/50/responsive/brandPersonality-sm.png 480w ,https://typogram.co/blog/media/posts/50/responsive/brandPersonality-md.png 768w ,https://typogram.co/blog/media/posts/50/responsive/brandPersonality-lg.png 1024w\"  alt=\"what is a brand \" width=\"1600\" height=\"900\"></figure>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What is inside our Brand Personality Workshop Kit?  </span></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This kit contains: </span></p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Explanation worksheets with interactive exercises help you understand and identify brand personality</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Custom brand personality cards with visual examples </span></li>\n</ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">By completing the three-step exercise in our workshop kit, you will learn, eliminate and finalize a chosen five top brand personalities, serving as visual directions and inspirations for your brand. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This workshop kit can accommodate a solopreneur or a small team of founders. It can be completed as a self-paced workshop or a collaborative team exercise. The exercise takes anywhere from 30 minutes to one hour, depending on the number of participants. We highly recommend you try this with your teammate or co-founder – it is a great team alignment exercise to start conversations about the visions for your business. As for file formats, the workshop is available in Google Slides, Notion, and PDF, so you may elect to complete this digitally or print it out on paper to get more hands-on. </span></p>\n<figure class=\"post__image\" ><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://typogram.co/blog/media/posts/50/brandPersonalityWorkshopPDF.gif\" alt=\"our brand personality workshop kit in PDF format  \" width=\"1200\" height=\"900\">\n<figcaption >our brand personality workshop kit in PDF format  </figcaption>\n</figure>\n<figure class=\"post__image\" ><img loading=\"lazy\" style=\"color: var(--text-primary-color); font-family: var(--editor-font-family); font-size: inherit; font-weight: var(--font-weight-normal);\" src=\"https://typogram.co/blog/media/posts/50/slider-digital-pic1-2x.png\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" srcset=\"https://typogram.co/blog/media/posts/50/responsive/slider-digital-pic1-2x-xs.png 300w ,https://typogram.co/blog/media/posts/50/responsive/slider-digital-pic1-2x-sm.png 480w ,https://typogram.co/blog/media/posts/50/responsive/slider-digital-pic1-2x-md.png 768w ,https://typogram.co/blog/media/posts/50/responsive/slider-digital-pic1-2x-lg.png 1024w\"  alt=\"our brand personality workshop kit inside Google slides\" width=\"1440\" height=\"1500\">\n<figcaption >our brand personality workshop kit inside Google slides</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<hr>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">How did we develop this kit? </span></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Our brand personality workshop kit originated and evolved from Typogram’s product development process. Initially, we wanted to identify a user experience flow for the brand personality feature inside the Typogram app: how can we make the brand personality a valuable feature to the users? What specific interactions can we include at this step, and what do they look like? </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With many hypotheses, we focused on shipping quickly for testing. We created this workshop using three popular No-Code tools easily accessible to our potential users: PDF, Google Slides, and Notion. Now that we have sped up the product development process using No-Code, we can focus on testing and making the UX as rewarding as possible. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The end product featured a main flow: users sort through different cards of brand personality and each time, they sort and choose using various methods: First, they identify based on a list of words and then narrow down based on images. Ultimately, users land on five words as visual themes/directions for their logos. Observing from our user testing session that branding is a starting point for conversation - we designed the workshop to work for solopreneurs or a team. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We organized user testing sessions and received great feedback. The success of user testing validated the flow and design of our brand personality feature inside Typogram! Because of the overwhelmingly positive response, we now make this kit a free resource for our community. </span></p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Access our Brand Personality Workshop Kit</span></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You can download our free </span><a href=\"https://workshop.typogram.co/\" title=\"Typogram's Brand Personality Workshop Kit\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Brand Personality Workshop Kit</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> on our website.

Because Typogram offers a one-brand lifetime license, you are locked down to a brand name once you purchase a paid license. However, we understand that sometimes, accidents happen. There can be spelling errors or incorrect name entries.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The old process for the brand name change was manually sending us an email or via the chat widget. Starting today, we have a better, more streamlined process: you can initiate a name change directly in the app through your project dashboard. Under the appropriate project, click “Request Change Brand Name,” to enter a new name for approval. It’ll usually approve within 24 hours.</span></p>\n<figure class=\"post__image\" ><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://typogram.co/blog/media/posts/49/brandNameChangeEditUpdate_2-2.gif\" alt=\"img: request to change brand name\" width=\"1440\" height=\"900\">\n<figcaption ><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">img: Request to change brand name</span></figcaption>\n</figure>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Upcoming: Modularized App Components &amp; Expanding Brand Personality Workshop</span></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We are currently reworking our app from the ground up with a brand-new direction to product thinking: </span><strong>modular steps and shareable work-in-progress.</strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> We take pride in our unique eight-step process for creating a professional brand, but its implementation in the app seems rigid regarding workflow adherence. You must go through a series of steps to reach the final destination—Brand Guidelines—which is the only place and time where you can share your work.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The new Typogram maintains the same brand design philosophies and workflows but is much more modular and flexible. We broke ground on this new app direction with Typogram’s first step—Brand Personality. Once completed, it will function as a modular component that can either stand alone as a mini app or serve as a segue to the full Typogram experience. The Brand Personality app will also feature a more visually stunning presentation you can save and publish. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Our plans for the future: every single step is a standalone app, much more robust, but at the same time, it is still part of the full Typogram experience. The brand design journey can start anywhere and in any order. The work product of each step is presented in a much more visually-impressive way, and you can save and share with your team or community to get feedback.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Let us know what you think of this future direction!</span></p>\n<h1> </h1>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Hearing from You</span></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We’d love to hear more of your thoughts if you have already tried the software.

There were a variety of reasons for this, which I will expand on later. Despite this setback, we still launched our product with the support of our community and gained new users, both free and paid! We’re still proud of what we accomplished and are grateful for the support we received.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br></span></p>\n<h2>We fell through a crack on Product Hunt</h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Product Hunt, the popular platform for discovering new and innovative products, has its fair share of quirks. One such quirk is the potential to fall through the cracks and not get featured on the front page.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What products get featured on the front page and why? From Product Hunt’s response to our complaint, it seems that manual curation plays a substantial role in their selection process:</span></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I very much regret the experience. We try our best to feature everything that is eligible and that we think will be a value add to our community. Every now and then, unfortunately, we do miss a great launch. — Product Hunt Support</span></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I think that the Product Hunt team must employ a combination of strategies to manage this workload efficiently. It seems implausible for a manual process alone to handle such a volume, making me question how they strike the right balance between human curation and algorithmic assistance. Whatever they do, mistakes happen, which is unfortunately on our part.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The “falling into Product Hunt crack” actually happens much more often than I realized. Just today, I observed another company that suffered the same fate as Typogram last Tuesday.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Look at the diagram from </span><a href=\"https://hunted.space/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">hunted.space</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, a site that collects Product Hunt launch statistics and analyzes trends.

It also has a flat line in the beginning section.</span></figcaption>\n</figure>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The flat line in the beginning doesn’t mean the product didn’t get votes during those times. It just means that they got no exposure that the stats crawler didn’t crawl. </span></i></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">During this time, Typogram is live on Product Hunt, but people only find it through the link we shared. In other words, we are sending traffic to Product Hunt, not the other way around. The moment we get unburied at hour 4, we already got 40 votes, purely from our own people! That is a miracle in itself! </span></p>\n<h2>How Launching on Product Hunt Works</h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We ask our community to visit Product Hunt and upvote our product, which in turn boosts our ranking. As our position improves, we attract more traffic from Product Hunt’s user base. Ideally, a successful launch results in significantly more traffic flowing from Product Hunt to our product than what we initially directed toward them. Unfortunately, it may not be the case for our launch this time.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When we finally got unburied, we had 40 votes and ranked #13. Ranking in #13 means we only get the exposure and traffic that belongs to #13, which is less than #12, which is less than #11 … you get my point. Assuming all products are equally interesting and have the same upvote ratio (the number of votes divided by the number of visitors), our vote gap is only getting larger and larger by default.</span></p>\n<p><strong>In order to climb up, we need to:</strong></p>\n<ol>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><strong>be more interesting so that the upvote ratio is higher</strong></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><strong>lead more outside traffic to your Product Hunt post</strong></li>\n</ol>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The #1 is done prior; nothing we can change on the launch day. I think our product is very unique and interesting. We trend up really quickly after we get onto the front page, thanks to that.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The #2 is counter-intuitive. We launch on Product Hunt to get more people to visit us, not the other way around. But in order to get more exposure, we have to send more traffic first. We continue to ask our community to show up and support us, and you all did. We climbed all the way from #13 to #5 in the early afternoon!</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Each position on Product Hunt corresponds to a certain level of traffic. To optimize your launch, it’s crucial to secure a top position as early as possible.</span></p>\n<p><strong>The traffic generated during a launch is determined by two factors:</strong></p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong> Your position on Product Hunt</strong></li>\n<li><strong> The duration you maintain that position</strong></li>\n</ol>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Even if some product manages to climb from the bottom to the top #1 spot at the last minute and earn the “Product of the Day” title, it won’t make a significant impact, as it would only benefit from one minute of the top position’s traffic. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We enjoyed about half a day of position #5’s traffic, and the other half day we get very little traffic.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The launch experience serves as a reminder of the importance of building our own audience. While leveraging platforms like Product Hunt can be beneficial, their outcomes are not always reliable. I was confident that our launch would secure the top #1 or #2 spot, especially since I had previously achieved #2 with a hobby project, Symbols to Copy. In comparison, Typogram is a much more interesting and robust product. Nonetheless, this experience underscores the need to focus on cultivating a community of user base independently.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Our community carried us through the launch. Without their support, we could have easily been buried throughout the entire day. Instead, we managed to emerge as #13 and continued to climb the ranks, demonstrating the power of an engaged community in driving a product’s growth.</span></p>\n<h2>Launch Stats</h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On launch day, we coincidentally acquired exactly 100 new users, and with additional sign-ups in the following week, we reached a total of 230 new users. Among these, 9 converted to paid users, resulting in a conversion rate of approximately 4%.</span></p>\n<figure class=\"post__image--wide\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://typogram.co/blog/media/posts/44/51c6586b-c80c-4083-89b8-c74fc800a3c2_720x402.png\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" srcset=\"https://typogram.co/blog/media/posts/44/responsive/51c6586b-c80c-4083-89b8-c74fc800a3c2_720x402-xs.png 300w ,https://typogram.co/blog/media/posts/44/responsive/51c6586b-c80c-4083-89b8-c74fc800a3c2_720x402-sm.png 480w ,https://typogram.co/blog/media/posts/44/responsive/51c6586b-c80c-4083-89b8-c74fc800a3c2_720x402-md.png 768w ,https://typogram.co/blog/media/posts/44/responsive/51c6586b-c80c-4083-89b8-c74fc800a3c2_720x402-lg.png 1024w\"  alt=\"\" width=\"720\" height=\"402\"></figure>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Despite feeling as though we were deprived of the #1 position, it's important to remember that a launch is not a sprint but a marathon. In the grand scheme of things, a year from now, this minor setback won't even matter the slightest. If someone is meant to become our user, we will undoubtedly cross paths with them eventually — we just have to keep going to meet them. </span></p>",

Here are the new features we have in the pipeline! </p>\n<hr>\n<h1>Upcoming New Feature: Extra Icons</h1>\n<p>A popular user request is adding extra icons next to the brand name. We are excited to announce an upcoming new feature, Extra Icons, which allows you to add icons next to the brand name text on the canvas. We are incredibly proud of this feature because it required overcoming significant technical challenges. We worked tirelessly to ensure that the design process remains smooth and intuitive for users while also allowing for the flexibility and customization options that Extra Icons provides.</p>\n<p>With Extra Icons, you also can readjust the position of the text and icon independently and recenter them on canvas. This new feature gives you complete control over your logo’s layout, allowing you to create the perfect balance and visual impact. It will help you take your branding to the next level and express your creativity in new and exciting ways.</p>\n<figure class=\"post__image\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/lYqRJZYKHhe-SCFna79Q-BSIw4560soMTqAJB3xWjjWXMgTUcFFtP8kEFJbdjkzmB0wfacyftj-cudFU1Md4349PcyBf-Ko66MBSnxQ1LLOwX1cuNwavE3q6OJMWh_Z3PMXJljMb6B-s_jYP6pfnj3E\" data-is-external-image=\"true\"  alt=\"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/lYqRJZYKHhe-SCFna79Q-BSIw4560soMTqAJB3xWjjWXMgTUcFFtP8kEFJbdjkzmB0wfacyftj-cudFU1Md4349PcyBf-Ko66MBSnxQ1LLOwX1cuNwavE3q6OJMWh_Z3PMXJljMb6B-s_jYP6pfnj3E\"><figcaption>Extra Icons in action!</figcaption></figure>\n<h1> </h1>\n<h1>Introducing Typogram Help Center</h1>\n<p>We launched <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\" href=\"https://typogram.co/help/\">Typogram Help Center</a>, a resource center for questions and how-tos for our logo design tool.
