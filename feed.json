It is one of the earliest features we built and one of the last features to revisit in preparation for our launch in January 2023.

In the last few weeks, we completely revamped the brand guideline page.</p>\n<p>We collected feedback from our pre-order customers and created this new design — a more dynamic layout with more breathing room. We also improved functionalities — making publishing a brand guidelines page more streamlined.</p>\n<h2 id=\"preview-brand-guidelines\">Preview Brand Guidelines</h2>\n<p>After the last step — choosing the typography system, we can preview the brand guidelines on the same page before it is officially published. Our chosen brand typography and colors are directly reflected on the guidelines page: the heading, paragraph, and even the download button label styles on the guidelines page are coherent with your brand’s typography system, the color of the page background, text, and border are also using the grayscale colors from your brand color palettes.</p>\n<p><figure class=\"post__image\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/zrcRuw9-uQ_65jbESXuWP9iGOuKMYgCv3pbO5_VT0wbNRHJ9H4phqzU6VisnEihpH19sczqgxlq9P0FGDjJP6uln3YYxlsdcY1i4n6Laxex5sbzJLCrSBJn8Vv42VbKUbcHh7J71lPy9gmrdedZ4WS0MzRUi4K_WTXvO9fwVWBFUOywgEv-avNZaxk7qOw\" data-is-external-image=\"true\"  alt=\"Preview Brand Guidelines\" /></figure></p>\n<figcaption align = \"center\">Your previous design choices applied to the brand guidelines page, such as the title typeface</figcaption>\n\n<h2 id=\"publish-brand-guidelines\">Publish Brand Guidelines</h2>\n<p>After making sure everything looks good to go, we can click on Publish Brand Guidelines button to finish off our Typogram journey.

See <a href=\"https://typogram.co/blog/typogram-product-update-no4/\">September</a> and our archive <a href=\"https://typogram.co/blog/tags/inside-typogram/\">here</a>)</p>\n<hr>\n<h1 id=\"choosing-brand-colors\">Choosing Brand Colors</h1>\n<p>This month, we focused on a critical feature: Brand Colors. From chatting with our customers, we know many struggles with brand colors, so we focused on making this feature as visual and accessible as possible.</p>\n<p>There are several things we have created in this feature to help you choose colors:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Preview Primary Brand Color in Graphics</li>\n<li>Grayscale Colors</li>\n<li>Accent Colors</li>\n<li>View Color Tips</li>\n<li>Hex Input and More</li>\n</ul>\n<hr>\n<h2 id=\"detail-1-preview-primary-brand-color-in-graphics\">Detail 1: Preview Primary Brand Color in Graphics</h2>\n<p>A common misconception is that color value is absolute and can stand on its own. While it is true mathematically, it is false optically. Our eyes absolutely do fool us at times — a red color can look 100% blue once put next to a set of certain colors and shades. It is essential to build a color palette for your brand instead of a singular color. With Typogram, you can preview the primary brand color palettes in a graphic in real time as you are making changes.</p>\n<p><figure class=\"post__image\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/vEFH-HQhistnsmasPrhvAHCiwnUK2FcAfZKg7L5A3IDz6DfsO8pmU5K89XdK0DLTcmLD6_OzP1pl66PoJG1QDWNFJPmRkGhV7FK1OGDCPZBz7xDgtQvfuQQOSO3BYHju2B_1KKqeBGfNn4cunbTMGAy2B8He1Ui_c4rUJCKP5XWC2JWn1I3fU7-JMg\" data-is-external-image=\"true\"  alt=\"Preview Primary Brand Color in Graphics\" /></figure></p>\n<figcaption align = \"center\"> Preview Primary Brand Color in Graphics</figcaption>\n\n\n\n<hr>\n<h2 id=\"detail-2-grayscale-colors\">Detail 2: Grayscale Colors</h2>\n<p>A common pitfall of branding is over-using brand color everywhere. A booklet full of bright blue text is not a good idea — when used excessively, the brand color disappears instead of standing out. Brand colors are meant to be used somewhat scarcely and stand out amid more neutral tones — that is where the grayscale color palette comes in. Grayscale colors have very low saturation, which you can adjust between 0% to 16%. It is also a good idea to make the “neutral” gray not entirely neutral. Inject the hue of the primary brand color into the grayscale colors to hint at your brand color subtly. Even when your logo is not present, users can still feel your brand’s presence because the dark gray text radiates your brand color in small doses. </p>\n<p><figure class=\"post__image\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/BDPFzagU7D6wc6y4jEylltPFqKYglkXhRzmDkj5iF9D-_7LUeOwoG771ukxSn8PDDJLauIXDFk_qKj0aACdfbiqn255PLgS9U-v5wCMGUkS_nY43k2EENpK4NrqHrBEsa0MJI5TEDxBdBh5i7DqdBL8fC1xrG2VbSsQJe_Mt7SeDPX05h1MHXYnzHA\" data-is-external-image=\"true\"  alt=\"gif: Grayscale Colors\" /></figure></p>\n<figcaption align = \"center\">Grayscale Colors</figcaption>\n\n<hr>\n<h2 id=\"detail-3-accent-colors\">Detail 3: Accent Colors</h2>\n<p>Unlike grayscale colors, which are a must-have, accent colors are optional and up to you to decide. Similar to grayscale colors’ “binding” to the primary brand color in hue values, accent colors bind with the primary color in saturation values to create harmony.</p>\n<p><figure class=\"post__image\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/E96ovZ-sXL0hNS8ju4dgFXt0_vwS-9mVGMkvmN_sjt1F11lNDdsF_swmP-s8dSRIkQUtsEK5SQFrIWcE7OhW89s_mrw0ZGO_tIzH6Ju9oACKWjfysIcVrBeASfBcvnBSt_DFu00lGJnZjXVAognOZZdq_dapHBfEdrtWm7Mmajgc8UhAKFsG8iKY6Q\" data-is-external-image=\"true\"  alt=\"Accent Colors\" /></figure></p>\n<figcaption align = \"center\">Accent Colors</figcaption>\n\n<hr>\n<h2 id=\"detail-4-view-color-tips\">Detail 4: View Color Tips</h2>\n<p>Choosing brand colors is not an instinct thing. Instinct will draw me to colors that appeal to me personally, but my favorite color will not be the most suitable for my company and its audience. We should ditch our instinct for a little bit and choose values in hue, saturation, and lightness, respectively, based on rationales. “View Tips” provide rationales to you in real-time while you drag the values up and down. What does hue 19 mean in brand color psychology? The tips section gives a direct, timely answer to help you decide.</p>\n<p><figure class=\"post__image\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/ZVbRB_C14nkZUz4jWTWY5_q7tuktr6jbWqNYc-wIqbv8WnEOAuoO3KD2mtUcc-GDO36kXMIUEgHF5HVXomjj3_pDQdvCcyHiLxyego8tdH-6vEvqR0YGft9ivVglXEDfxdNz0gW_yFv1nqt08qLStVJSN2Yd_20zH_vfi0x4tSM8OuXArHkoslwJzQ\" data-is-external-image=\"true\"  alt=\"View Color Tips\" /></figure></p>\n<figcaption align = \"center\">View Color Tips</figcaption>\n\n<hr>\n<h2 id=\"detail-5-hex-input-and-more\">Detail 5: Hex Input and More</h2>\n<p>While HSL (hue, saturation, and lightness) is Typogram’s chosen way to define a color, you may already have a color that you want to bring in. Simply input the hex value with or without “#” or the color names and hit enter; if it is a valid color code or name, Typogram will recognize it and set HSL values accordingly. If it is not a valid color, the app will revert to the last valid color you selected.</p>\n<p><figure class=\"post__image\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/CgcPBQl3FkEvVdSMw1gKEgHP1jObxdKTjbw4Ir4KwASnap2it1-MVAxdHHAZBc4At1Ve3AZRu6WF43AqPrSHGc9AiaKJT3k8j9aRh9AYF6RxzIvLg220sZe9PXXah2xHfpA-au0E7OBu-8a9ba3Htfa9yR39YmNGIGvCs7AE0d5RHf095jvQAeIOJg\" data-is-external-image=\"true\"  alt=\"Hex Input and More\" /></figure></p>\n<figcaption align = \"center\">Hex Input and More</figcaption>\n\n<hr>\n<h1 id=\"save--access-brand-color-swatches\">Save &amp; Access Brand Color Swatches</h1>\n<p>Once the brand colors are chosen, they are saved and can be accessed via the color swatch panel.

Over the years that I worked at Adobe, I bought into the <a href=\"https://g.co/kgs/uzvnbm\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">ADBE</a> stock through labor (RSU) and money (ESPP). A big portion of my net worth is held in ADBE stock, and that stock sunk 20% on a single day — the day they announced Adobe would acquire Figma for $20 billion. </p>\n<p>This newsletter series started on Aug 2nd, 2021, days after I left my position at the Adobe. Prior to founding <a href=\"https://typogram.co/\">Typogram</a>, I spent a year and a half working on <a href=\"https://www.adobe.com/products/xd.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Adobe XD</a> and five years on another Adobe acquisition Typekit (now called <a href=\"https://fonts.adobe.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Adobe Fonts</a>). I felt the blow on multiple levels. One that I was once devoted to Adobe XD, spending days and nights trying to win the battle with Figma, but now the acquisition announces Adobe XD’s premature defeat. One that I mentioned earlier — the blow in my wallet.</p>\n<h2 class=\"header-with-anchor-widget\">$20 billion is four times over-priced</h2>\n<p>Let’s begin with the wallet blow. Not every investor of ADBE stock is like me, who held a grudge because they worked on the internal competitor product. Why do other investors hate the acquisition, as shown by the stock price plunge? The simple answer is that the $20 billion price tag is too expensive.</p>\n<p>Startup evaluation is complex, but there are shortcuts we can take to do a rough estimate. We can try to estimate in two different ways:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Figma last raised funds at a valuation of $10 billion in June 2021. At first glance, it might make sense: Figma is doing so well that it doubled its valuation in a year of time between 2021 and 2022. Except 2021 is at the peak of startup valuation, most startups cut their valuation by a lot in 2022, including those doing well. Taking Canva, another contender in the design space, for example, its valuation declined from $40 billion in 2021 to $26 billion in 2022, despite that they are doing well. Apply the same ratio to Figma, the Figma 2022 valuation is estimated to be <strong>$6.5 billion</strong>.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Another way to peek at a startup’s valuation is by revenue and growth multiplier. High-growth startups may have a high multiplier like 10x. Figma is targeted to hit $400 million in revenue, assuming it has already hit the target revenue, multiple by a high multiplier of 10x — its valuation is at <strong>$4 billion</strong>.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>I think the actual value of Figma is around <strong>$5 billion</strong>. $20 billion would be four times overpriced; hence investors dropped the stock on the heel of the acquisition announcement. Nobody likes a bad deal. To reach such a deal, it must be Adobe begged to acquire Figma; it was not a level field negotiation. Why does Adobe need Figma so badly?</p>\n<h2 class=\"header-with-anchor-widget\">Organization chart oddity</h2>\n<p>Reading Figma’s CEO’s <a href=\"https://www.figma.com/blog/a-new-collaboration-with-adobe/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">blog post</a> announcement, after the acquisition, he will report to David Wadhwani, not Scott Belsky, which stands out as odd to me. Scott Belsky is the person in charge of Creative Cloud. You may see him in every Adobe Max keynote talking about Creative Cloud products. After the acquisition announcement, the “design Twitter” jokingly mocked up Figma’s app icon in Creative Cloud form — it was transparent to everyone that Figma would be part of Creative Cloud; then why does the Figma CEO not report to the head of Creative Cloud?</p>\n<figure class=\"post__image\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:best,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F92e1ff16-07b9-4384-9c05-550563b1c66a_1587x1080.jpeg\" data-is-external-image=\"true\"  alt=\"Internet meme about Figma being acquired by Adobe\"><figcaption>Internet meme about Figma being acquired by Adobe</figcaption></figure>\n<p>The answer, I now speculate as an outsider, is that David Wadhwani is the one who led and pushed through the acquisition, not Scott Belsky; therefore, the new Figma org reports to him. </p>\n<p>Adobe has invested heavily in Adobe XD, <a href=\"https://blog.adobe.com/en/publish/2015/10/05/introducing-project-comet-a-new-tool-for-designing-and-prototyping-user-experiences\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">first announced to public as Project Comet in Oct 2015, 7 years ago</a>. While it is surely not as popular as Figma, it is nothing less than a successful product, strengthening the Creative Cloud ecosystem. According to the <a href=\"https://uxtools.co/survey-2021/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">2021 design tools survey</a> (the latest, 2022 survey has yet to come out), Adobe XD is the 3rd most popular UI design tool and 2nd most popular UI prototyping tool. Compared to <a href=\"https://uxtools.co/survey-2020/#ui-design\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">2020 design tools survey</a>, Adobe XD is on the rise — it jumped from 3rd to 2nd place in UI prototyping category and shortened the gap between itself and 2nd place in the UI design category:</p>\n<figure class=\"post__image\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F09679d21-7de2-48fc-b234-7a72678f6d89_1778x604.png\" data-is-external-image=\"true\"  alt=\"Design Tools Survey 2020 vs. 2021, source: uxtools.co\"><figcaption>Design Tools Survey 2020 vs. 2021, source: uxtools.co</figcaption></figure>\n<p>As a user, we may view products as 1 or 0 — if I don’t use it, it almost doesn’t exist. But the market is vast and diverse; you might be surprised how many companies are using Adobe XD over Figma. All this is to say: </p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>Adobe XD is a considerable investment; Adobe has worked on it for more than seven years; </p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Adobe XD is rising, not failing</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Figma not reporting to the head of Creative Cloud sends a bad signal to me, almost a red flag. Did a group of business people decide to buy Figma without any serious consideration of Adobe XD’s effort? Have the “decision makers” ever even opened Adobe XD before they come to the conclusion that Adobe must have Figma for $20 billion? For Adobe to either admit XD’s defeat and have Figma annex XD, or strategize upon having two similar products grow side by side, it should most certainly involve the team who spent 7+ years building Adobe’s equivalence of Figma. It would be ignorant not to consult with them and have a thorough analysis of what Adobe XD is lacking in comparison to Figma and how difficult is it to build the missing parts.</p>\n<h2 class=\"header-with-anchor-widget\">Conflict of interest</h2>\n<p>Who is David Wadhwani, the person Figma is going to report to? I have never heard of this name while working at Adobe. A little further research shows he joined Adobe in June 2021, just over a year ago. His last position prior was Venture Partner at venture capital firm <a href=\"https://greylock.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Greylock</a>. In his <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/davidwadhwani/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">LinkedIn</a> and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/dwadhwani\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Twitter </a>profile, he is still a partner at Greylock; unknown to me whether it is outdated information due to lack of updates. Greylock invested in Figma in Series A, B, C, D, and E! Figma Series A’s price was $0.2 per share; it 200x’ed at the acquisition deal. I think there is a conflict of interest for David to lead the acquisition of Figma in Adobe, if David is still working for Greylock or if he has personally invested in Figma. </p>\n<figure class=\"post__image\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9ce0542d-1ea7-4b52-ba47-d24250b16e61_1377x668.jpeg\" data-is-external-image=\"true\"  alt=\"Figma’s funding history\"><figcaption>Figma’s funding history</figcaption></figure>\n<p>For context, <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2022/04/27/elon-musk-wins-shareholder-lawsuit-over-the-companys-2point6-billion-solarcity-acquisition.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Elon Musk got sued by shareholders</a> in a similar situation. Musk’s company Tesla acquired SolarCity, a company founded by Musk’s cousins and backed by Musk. However, Musk did win the lawsuit in the end. With the context in mind, I believe it is reasonable to raise the question about conflict of interest, while it needs more investigation to allege there is actual wrongdoing. </p>\n<h2 class=\"header-with-anchor-widget\">“Forward-looking statements”</h2>\n<div id=\"§forward-looking-statements\" class=\"header-anchor-widget\">\n<div class=\"header-anchor-widget-button-container\">\n<div class=\"header-anchor-widget-button\"> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>While there is nothing I look forward to in this transaction, the “forward-looking statements” disclaimer from Figma’s CEO is <a href=\"https://www.figma.com/blog/a-new-collaboration-with-adobe/#disclaimer\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">an interesting read</a>, which I quote below:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Each of the forward-looking statements we make in this communication involves risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from these forward-looking statements. Factors that might cause or contribute to such differences include, but are not limited to: expected revenues, cost savings, synergies and other benefits from the proposed transaction, such as <strong>Adobe’s ability to enhance Creative Cloud by adding Figma’s collaboration-first product design capabilities and the effectiveness of Figma’s technology, might not be realized within the expected time frames or at all</strong> and costs or difficulties relating to integration matters, including but not limited to customer and employee retention, might be greater than expected…</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I painfully laugh at this disclaimer, for how true it might be. I think the best outcome for users is for Figma to remain largely the same. But even with Adobe keeping Figma as independent as it can be, it will develop and grow at a much slower pace since there will be no venture capital funds pouring in, and Adobe’s resources drained to pay off the acquisition cost. The only winner is Figma investors. This acquisition is a lose-lose-lose situation for Adobe, Figma, and the design community. </p>\n<p>With accelerated stock vesting triggered by the acquisition, a lot of Figma employees will jump ship to their next adventure. It is hard to blame them — they are rich now, so why not become angel investors or found their own company? That is the bright side of this acquisition — more competition is always better. Figma helped Adobe XD become better, and vice versa: “<a href=\"https://help.figma.com/hc/en-us/articles/360039818874-Create-advanced-animations-with-smart-animate\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Smart Animate</a>” came from Adobe XD to Figma; “<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5JaQBWSB88w&amp;ab_channel=AdobeCreativeCloud\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Live Co-editing</a>” came from Figma to Adobe XD (Ah Yes, Adobe XD supports multi-player mode for three years now). I await to see what the design tool experts from Figma will bring to the world next.</p>\n<h2 class=\"header-with-anchor-widget\">❧</h2>\n<p>Did you know that we also have a build in public newsletter?

Here are the features we have been working for September.<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Missed the previous updates? See </span><a href=\"https://typogram.co/blog/typogram-product-update-june-2022/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">June</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, </span><a href=\"https://typogram.co/blog/typogram-product-update-july-2022/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">July</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, and </span><a href=\"https://typogram.co/blog/typogram-product-update-no3/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">August.</span></a></p>\n<hr>\n<h1>Save Multiple Projects on the Cloud</h1>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">An exciting update to Typogram is that projects can now be saved to the cloud under user accounts. Until now, our features were developed with a saving mechanism using the browser’s localStorage. However, saving projects to the cloud is essential -- We can finally do that now! A notable feature we supported is to merge artboards created and stored locally before logging in with artboards fetched from the cloud after logging in; this way, no progress is lost.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We reached out to every pre-order customer to talk to them about their brand needs, and these conversations are so helpful to us in making a better product. One of the first things we discovered was the need for multiple branding projects, contrary to what we initially presumed. It is a use case that we must support since some of our pre-order customers have already bought multiple licenses for multiple branding projects. I can also imagine this feature helpful for other scenarios, like deciding between different brand names.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Look at the screencast below that loads different projects from the cloud. We store which step you are at with each project, and upon loading, scroll to your current step so you can quickly get back to where you were at and continue designing your brand:</span></p>\n<figure class=\"post__image\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:best,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd201aa43-fc85-4626-9b00-ede7e972758a_1440x900.gif\" data-is-external-image=\"true\"  alt=\"The project card is relatively unstyled; we will continue to improve it with a better preview and more.\"><figcaption><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The project card is relatively unstyled; we will continue to improve it with a better preview and more</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.</span></figcaption></figure>\n<h1> </h1>\n<h1>Overcoming Technical Challenges</h1>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We also overcame a significant engineering challenge. In the last few weeks, we had rendering issues with the editable icons. We thought it was a problem with the third-party library we used to render the variable font files — a font technology we used for the editable icons. Without fixing the issue, our editable icon project was at a halt — there was no point in spending more time developing icons that could not be properly rendered. We have to find a solution quickly to resume the editable icon project.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We decided to dive into the codebase of the third-party library in search of a solution. It was a significant challenge at first — unfamiliar with the code, we had no idea what was going on between the lines. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However, after patience and help from the author of the library, the code started to make sense line by line. We dug deep and revealed some information that we configured in the variable font file was not properly interpreted by the library. We can change the library to interpret it better, or there was an easier way — write the information into the font in the way the library wanted to handle it. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It was a surprising turn that led us to the font creation software we used, and a simple change in the font script fixed the problem. The debugging process not only unblocked our icon project but also helped us understand better the third-party library we relied on. It also heightened our understanding of variable font technology in general. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">...And that’s it for this month!</span></p>\n<p> </p>",

In order to ship a quality product, unfortunately, we have to ask you to wait a little longer — our targeted launch date changes from September to January. We are very sorry for the delay and hope you stay with us. If the launch postponement changes your mind about us, we understand entirely, and it is on us. As always, we offer full refunds.

Here are personal reflections from each of us:</span></p>\n<h3><strong>Wenting</strong></h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In hindsight, underestimating the work scope is the main mistake that set us back — for example, I underestimated the workload surrounding backend development. The account feature is taking much longer and diminishes my momentum. The </span><a href=\"https://typogram.co/blog/typogram-product-update-july-2022/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">editable icon project</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> my co-founder is working on also shares the same problem. We need to look at this problem internally and find solutions to estimate work scope and set deadlines more accurately. We have internal deadlines for each project, and missing them often hurts our morale and momentum. </span></p>\n<h3><strong>Hua</strong></h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Reflecting upon the progress with editable icons, the main thing that sets us back is the lack of understanding of the technical and design processes. Editable icons are something new - deciding and trying out different designs and tech specs were time-consuming and a process of trial and error. Because of this, I underestimated how long it took to create these icons. As I learn more, I understand this creation process better, which guides me to make better, more accurate estimations of project milestones. </span></p>\n<p> </p>\n<h1><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Looking Forward</span></h1>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After we emailed our customers and community about delaying the launch date, surprising to us, we received nothing but positive support from our pre-oder customers and our community. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While we continue our journey towards our product launch in January</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> 2023, we will keep sharing what we built and learned via our monthly updates and we look forward to building Typogram together with our great community, your feedback, and advice.</span></p>",

Here are the features we have been working for July. Missed the previous updates?

Each icon is designed with multiple “style” sliders, and by specifying values on the sliders, you can customize the icon’s dimensions, shapes, and appearances to your liking and what fits your logo the best.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Taking this flower icon as an example, you can control the ratio of width and height, as well as the appearance of the flower, without any path manipulation, a complex and time-consuming task, even for professionals. We will continue releasing icon updates until our official launch.</span></p>\n<figure class=\"post__image\" ><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://typogram.co/blog/media/posts/30/flower-icon-800_edit_opt.gif\" alt=\"Editable flower icon\" width=\"800\" height=\"607\">\n<figcaption ><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Editable flower icon</span></i></figcaption>\n</figure>\n<figure class=\"post__image\" ><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://typogram.co/blog/media/posts/30/icon-heart-angular-2.gif\" alt=\"editable icon makes easier customization\" width=\"872\" height=\"668\">\n<figcaption >Editable icon makes easier customization</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<h1> </h1>\n<h1>User Accounts</h1>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On another less exciting but more essential front, we have added account management. Besides supporting the good old Email and Password sign-on, we also included social sign-on methods like the “Signed-in with Google” option to speed things up! The account menu can be accessed by moving the mouse near the right edge of the window. We think user experience design quality is essential to a design app like ours, so we fine-tuned the overall animation to be smooth and symmetrical with the design step menu on the left side:</span></p>\n<figure class=\"post__image\" ><figure class=\"post__image\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://typogram.co/blog/media/posts/30/Account-Management.gif\" alt=\"User account management\" width=\"1440\" height=\"900\"></figure>\n<figcaption >User account management</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">That's it for this month!

In 1816, William Caslon IV created the first official sans serif typeface, Caslon, for commercial use. Though Caslon didn’t become popular immediately, Sans Serif boomed in popularity decades later. Furthermore, They break down into smaller style categories: Grotesque, Neo Grotesque, Humanist, and Geometric. </p>\n<figure class=\"post__image\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://typogram.co/blog/media/posts/28/serifSanserif-2.png\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" srcset=\"https://typogram.co/blog/media/posts/28/responsive/serifSanserif-2-xs.png 300w ,https://typogram.co/blog/media/posts/28/responsive/serifSanserif-2-sm.png 480w ,https://typogram.co/blog/media/posts/28/responsive/serifSanserif-2-md.png 768w ,https://typogram.co/blog/media/posts/28/responsive/serifSanserif-2-lg.png 1024w\"  alt=\"sanserifserif\" width=\"1456\" height=\"761\"><figcaption>Sans serifs have no serifs</figcaption></figure>\n<h2>Grotesque Sans Serif<a id=\"Grotesque\"></a></h2>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Grotesque sans serifs were the earliest sans serif, influenced by the Modern style serif.
