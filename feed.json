For example, usually, there is the italic style within a font family - a group of letters with a degree of slant. Font style can come in normal, italic, and oblique. The Normal style is when the text is upright. The italic style is usually calligraphic, cursive-influenced, and slanted. The Oblique style is slanted version of the Normal style. </p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Faux Font Style</span></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Faux Styles happen when text editors or web browsers fake a font style because the original font does not have one. For example, a faux italic, or a “fake” italic, is created by browsers when the web fonts used lack italic styles. Avoid Faux versions if the appropriate styles are available. </span></p>\n<div class=\"font-family-preview\" data-value=\"idle_sticker_1\">\n<div class=\"font-family-flex-container\">\n<div id=\"idle_sticker_1\" class=\"sticker\">\n<div>interact with me!</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"font-family-flex-items letter-box fs-lb\"><span id=\"previewFontStyle\" class=\"letter-preview\">a</span></div>\n<div class=\"font-family-flex-items control-panel fs-cp\"><label class=\"ui-label\">Font Style</label>\n<div class=\"select font-style-select\">\n<div id=\"normal\" class=\"font-style-option font-style-active\" data-value=\"normal\">normal</div>\n<div id=\"faux italic\" class=\"font-style-option\" data-value=\"normal\">Faux Italic</div>\n<div id=\"true italic\" class=\"font-style-option\" data-value=\"italic\">True Italic</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"figcaption\">Hover on the dropdown to explore font styles</div>\n<hr class=\"section-break\">\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ligature </span></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ligatures are unique characters created from multiple letters of common letter combinations to improve readability in a font.  For example, the letter \"f\" has a high frequency of occurring with \"i\" and \"l\", as in words like “figure” and “flower.” To improve the readability in these specific cases,  \"fi\" and \"fl\", would be combined to create a unique character that would replace the two letters when typed together.</span></p>\n<figure class=\"post__image\" ><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://www.typogram.co/blog/media/posts/16/ligature-2.png\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" srcset=\"https://www.typogram.co/blog/media/posts/16/responsive/ligature-2-xs.png 300w ,https://www.typogram.co/blog/media/posts/16/responsive/ligature-2-sm.png 480w ,https://www.typogram.co/blog/media/posts/16/responsive/ligature-2-md.png 768w ,https://www.typogram.co/blog/media/posts/16/responsive/ligature-2-lg.png 1024w\"  alt=\"ligature\" width=\"2184\" height=\"1142\">\n<figcaption >Words with and without ligature</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<hr class=\"section-break\">\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Font Classification </span></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Fonts are commonly classified into four main categories based on their appearances.

Serifs originated from inscriptional lettering: Words were first painted with a brush, then carved into stones in Roman antiquity. Serifs are classified into several smaller categories: Old Style, Transitional, Modern, and Slab Serif.</span></p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sans Serif </span></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sans means “without.” Sans Serifs do not have serifs extending at the end of strokes. Sans Serifs were invented long after Serif. In 1816, William Caslon IV created the first official sans serif typeface, Caslon, for commercial use. Though Caslon didn’t become popular right away, Sans Serif boomed in popularity decades later. Sans Serifs are also further broken down into smaller style categories: Grotesque, Neo Grotesque, Humanist, and Geometric.</span></p>\n<figure class=\"post__image\" ><figure class=\"post__image\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://www.typogram.co/blog/media/posts/16/serifSanserif-2.png\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" srcset=\"https://www.typogram.co/blog/media/posts/16/responsive/serifSanserif-2-xs.png 300w ,https://www.typogram.co/blog/media/posts/16/responsive/serifSanserif-2-sm.png 480w ,https://www.typogram.co/blog/media/posts/16/responsive/serifSanserif-2-md.png 768w ,https://www.typogram.co/blog/media/posts/16/responsive/serifSanserif-2-lg.png 1024w\"  alt=\"Serif and Sans Serif\" width=\"1456\" height=\"761\"></figure>\n<figcaption >Serif and Sans Serif</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<hr class=\"section-break\">\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Display </span></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Display fonts are often fonts with unrestrained, decorative details. They look more visually stimulating than restrained, simple fonts used for paragraph text. Display fonts are used at header sizes, grabbing people’s attention right away. Many display fonts do not have good readability in small sizes because of their more ornate shapes. Their font details get lost in small sizes, thus decreasing their legibility. </span></p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Script</span></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Scripts are fonts mimicking handwriting. Influenced by cursives and calligraphy, scripts can be considered formal or casual. Formal scripts tend to be highly decorative, with swashes and exaggerated curls. Casual scripts are more subdued with less exuberant details.</span></p>\n<figure class=\"post__image\" ><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://www.typogram.co/blog/media/posts/16/scriptDisplay.png\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" srcset=\"https://www.typogram.co/blog/media/posts/16/responsive/scriptDisplay-xs.png 300w ,https://www.typogram.co/blog/media/posts/16/responsive/scriptDisplay-sm.png 480w ,https://www.typogram.co/blog/media/posts/16/responsive/scriptDisplay-md.png 768w ,https://www.typogram.co/blog/media/posts/16/responsive/scriptDisplay-lg.png 1024w\"  alt=\"Display and Script\" width=\"2184\" height=\"1142\">\n<figcaption >Display and Script</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<hr class=\"section-break\">\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Monospace Fonts</span></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Most fonts are proportional, where each character takes as much width as it needs.

Over time, they feel more and more uneasy and distrustful regarding tech companies. According to <a href=\"https://www.techrepublic.com/article/data-privacy-is-a-growing-concern-for-more-consumers/#:~:text=A%20full%2086%25%20of%20the,even%20trust%20their%20own%20employers.\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">KPMG</a>, </p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>A full 86% of the respondents said they feel a growing concern about data privacy, while 78% expressed fears about the amount of data being collected. Some 40% of the consumers surveyed don't trust companies to use their data ethically, and 13% don't even trust their own employers.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This uneasiness didn't occur overnight. It was a chronic issue that became more painful as more scandals about data abuse and privacy infringement broke out in the last decade. Many consumers are more reluctant to try new products and tech. I know I am, and I'm not alone. </p>\n<p>Therefore, it became essential for tech companies to show they are friendly and cheerful — an important way to make a good impression and gain users' trust. Many tech companies choose humanist or geometric sans serifs to communicate these tones, a bright color palette, cheerful illustrations, and quirky animations. Since there is already mistrust, it is more important than ever to have trust at first sight. </p>\n<p>Here are a few quotes from startups and tech companies themselves to illustrate the importance of being friendly and delightful.</p>\n<div class=\"captioned-image-container\">\n<figure>\n<figure class=\"post__image\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://www.typogram.co/blog/media/posts/15//google_before_after.png\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" srcset=\"https://www.typogram.co/blog/media/posts/15//responsive/google_before_after-xs.png 300w ,https://www.typogram.co/blog/media/posts/15//responsive/google_before_after-sm.png 480w ,https://www.typogram.co/blog/media/posts/15//responsive/google_before_after-md.png 768w ,https://www.typogram.co/blog/media/posts/15//responsive/google_before_after-lg.png 1024w\"  alt=\"\" width=\"1012\" height=\"506\"></figure>\n<a class=\"image-link image2\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" href=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe2c2160c-d40e-4522-9238-44c75c15df90_1012x506.png\"><picture></picture></a></figure>\n</div>\n<p>Google on their rebranding logo, 2015</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><em>We think we’ve taken the best of Google (simple, uncluttered, colorful, friendly), and recast it not just for the Google of today, but for the Google of the future. –<a href=\"https://www.wired.co.uk/article/google-new-logo\" target=\"null\" rel=\"nofollow\">Wired</a></em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<div class=\"captioned-image-container\">\n<figure>\n<figure class=\"post__image align-center\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://www.typogram.co/blog/media/posts/15//robinhood.png\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" srcset=\"https://www.typogram.co/blog/media/posts/15//responsive/robinhood-xs.png 300w ,https://www.typogram.co/blog/media/posts/15//responsive/robinhood-sm.png 480w ,https://www.typogram.co/blog/media/posts/15//responsive/robinhood-md.png 768w ,https://www.typogram.co/blog/media/posts/15//responsive/robinhood-lg.png 1024w\"  alt=\"\" width=\"697\" height=\"453\"></figure>\n</figure>\n</div>\n<p>Robinhood on introducing new illustration styles and typefaces as part of their rebrand, 2020</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>A new illustration style: delightful and future-focused.

The arrival of smartphones introduced a groundbreaking idea: a product can exist in multiple workspaces, most conveniently, on our phones.  Startup branding and user experience had now been tied more than ever.</p>\n<p>By being a completely different device with a new interaction model, the mobile platform made designing a product more complex. People use the product and interact with the brand at screens much smaller than desktops. Companies must think about user experience across different devices when it comes to how consumers experience their brands.</p>\n<p>Google on their rebranding, 2015</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>...You expect Google to help you whenever and wherever you need it, whether it’s on your mobile phone, TV, watch, the dashboard in your car, and yes, even a desktop! –<em><a href=\"https://www.wired.co.uk/article/google-new-logo\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Wired</a></em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Robinhood on their rebranding, 2020</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>A bold evolution of our brand — an inspiring and imaginative new visual identity — to complement the interface you love from your Robinhood account. –<em><a href=\"https://blog.robinhood.com/news/2020/8/5/a-visual-identity-that-better-reflects-our-vision\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Robinhood Blog</a></em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Mobile awareness made startups and tech companies favor simple sans serif wordmark logos, which is way more screen-friendly due to better readability. Sans serif has simpler letter shapes from lack of serifs and stroke contrasts than its serif counterpart or a logo with ornate iconography.</p>\n<h1> </h1>\n<h1>Parallel Between History of Sans Serif &amp; Brand Visions </h1>\n<p>Lastly, there is an interesting parallel between the history of sans serif and the Brand visions offered by startup and tech companies. </p>\n<p>When sans serif typefaces first came around, people hated how they looked compared to the more classic calligraphy-inspired serifs. They eliminated the serif's ornate, elegant letter shapes and preferred straight lines and simpler forms. They were considered ... grotesque( <em>remember</em> <a href=\"https://fontdiscovery.typogram.co/p/designindex?s=w\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\"><em>grotesque</em></a><em> sans serif?).</em></p>\n<figure class=\"post__image\" ><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://www.typogram.co/blog/media/posts/15//grotesque.png\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" srcset=\"https://www.typogram.co/blog/media/posts/15//responsive/grotesque-xs.png 300w ,https://www.typogram.co/blog/media/posts/15//responsive/grotesque-sm.png 480w ,https://www.typogram.co/blog/media/posts/15//responsive/grotesque-md.png 768w ,https://www.typogram.co/blog/media/posts/15//responsive/grotesque-lg.png 1024w\"  alt=\"\" width=\"1456\" height=\"761\">\n<figcaption >Grotesque sans serif was considered ugly</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<p>What sans serif stands for — simplicity and reduction— match what most tech companies promise: better, more efficient results through a simplified process that significantly improves the original (traditional) methods. This is perhaps one of the key reasons why many agencies love to use sans serif for tech rebrands in addition to user experience and a \"friendly\" brand image. </p>\n<h1> </h1>\n<h1>Cross-Pollinating Between Industries</h1>\n<p>Is it possible that this trend comes from fashion companies? </p>\n<p>As noted in our <a href=\"https://fontdiscovery.typogram.co/p/luxurybrandlogos?s=w\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">previous post,</a> fashion companies are also rebranding to sans serif. Is it possible that tech companies looked to fashion industries for some tips on how to elevate their brand images and give it a hip makeover? I think it’s very likely. </p>\n<h1> </h1>",

We launched on the same day, and her product is at the 5th spot throughout the day, while ours climbed from 14th to 10th spot and finally got to the front page of Product Hunt in mid-day. She contacted a few friends before her launch to get the word out about her product. I think her strategy worked! I also noticed the top 1 product got more than 20 votes within minutes after launch! I don’t think it is organic. Once you occupy the top spots right off the bat, then more people will click into your product page throughout the day, and then proportionally, you will get more upvotes. Instead of rallying support at the beginning of the launch, I sent out the newsletter mid-day to promote our launch. I should send it earlier the next time!</span></p>\n<h4><strong>Traffic Analysis</strong></h4>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Different from our codingfont.com launch, which went on the front page of Hacker News twice, </span><a href=\"https://www.typogram.co/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">typogram.co</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> didn’t get to the front page of Hacker News. This difference has a huge impact on the amount of traffic we get. CodingFont has 22,000 site visitors on launch day alone, 36,000 visitors within the first week, whereas Typogram only got 1,500 visitors for the first two weeks. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Numbers cited from </span><a href=\"https://build.typogram.co/p/stats-of-coding-font-launch?s=w\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Stats of Coding Font Launch</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">:</span></p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">36,729 users visited codingfont.com, </span>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"2\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">22,000 on Launch day</span></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Among the traffic with a referral source</span>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"2\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">43% from </span><a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=29010443\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Hacker News</span></a></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"2\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">4% from </span><a href=\"https://www.producthunt.com/posts/coding-font\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Product Hunt</span></a></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For 1,500 visitors, we got 16 pre-orders; the conversion rate is not so shabby! The only problem is how to get more people to visit our site and know we exist. Getting onto the front page of Hacker News will definitely help a lot! </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I did more research on how to get on the front page of hacker news. One thing I learned is that every upvote on HackerNews front page roughly translates to 100 visits - so if the post has 200 upvotes, it should have about 20,000 visits on that day. That corresponds to my experience in the past. My projects got onto the front page of Hacker News about five times throughout the years; however, I failed to get the one post that mattered the most to the front page! It is a bummer, but I think there is hope to leverage other side projects that fit Hacker News’ appetite to promote our main business. I have always loved doing those side projects, and I think it is a growth hack worth a try! I am planning to develop CodingFont.com version 2.0 with more features and have a more prominent call out of Typogram in the design. </span></p>\n<h4><strong>Where Do We Go From Here? </strong></h4>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">More organic marketing. What we learned is that launch is not a single-day event. We plan to post about our product on other platforms, like Reddit, Elpha, and IndieHackers, and keep organic marketing until launch. We don’t intend to spend on advertisements before the official launch.</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Meet customers. We have already chatted with some of our pre-order customers about their use cases and why they pre-ordered. Listen to our customers and learn what we did right and where we can improve between now and the official launch. </span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">SEO. I think for the long-term, search should be the primary driver for site traffic. We are publishing more premium content on our </span><a href=\"https://www.typogram.co/blog/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Typogram Blog</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> to drive search traffic to our site. One of the lesser-spoken milestones with this launch is that we have moved our blog to the /blog subdirectory — the first major action to improve SEO!</span></li>\n</ul>\n<p> </p>",

You might be reading this because we just launched our preorder page for our app, <a href=\"https://www.typogram.co/\">Typogram</a>. Typogram is a design tool that we have been working on. Specifically, it’s a beginner-friendly logo design and editing tool for non-designers. <strong><em>Today, we are launching our pre-order. We are offering one brand lifetime license for $49.99, at 60% discount.

We want to make design more accessible for non-designers. This launch is a special milestone because Typogram has been an idea in the works for a long time. We wanted to share our journey to this point so far.  </p>\n<h2>What was the start of Typogram?</h2>\n<p>Typogram started out as a professional tool for designers in its earliest stage. As we ran around with equipment and interviewed users, we realized that this app better served non-designers. We had met many newly minted business owners looking to launch their product with a presentable, eye-catching website branded with marketing and a unique logo. They needed their logos designed but didn’t know who to turn to. Many ended up designing logos themselves and complained about the lack of learning resources and an easy-to-use, beginner-friendly tool, geared especially for non-designers to design logos. </p>\n<p>After hearing about this pain point, we put our heads down to work by creating free design education resources for entrepreneurs, like<a href=\"https://fontdiscovery.typogram.co/\"> FontDiscovery</a>, doing<a href=\"https://workshop.typogram.co/#about\"> workshops</a> at accelerators like Yale’s<a href=\"https://city.yale.edu/\"> Tsai City</a>, and co-working spaces, like<a href=\"https://www.the-wing.com/\"> the Wing</a>. In addition, we made mini design tools, like<a href=\"https://www.codingfont.com/\"> Coding Font</a>.  </p>\n<p>We also developed our features quickly using no-code tools and tested out our app with an initial group of customers. We brought users on-site, had them test out our apps, nervously observed their interactions with our app. When the pandemic hit, we user tested remotely. Eventually, we figured out what worked, what didn’t and built out the features with code! Our customers were happy with what we have and paid us.</p>\n<h2>What was the most challenging part of this launch? </h2>\n<p>As shy creatives and engineers, the most challenging aspect of this launch had two layers. First, putting ourselves out there in many unexpected ways, and second, internalized pressure of launching and the desire to be perfect. This was a massive project for us and required us to put ourselves out there consistently. An example is the making of landing page marketing and our product video. We wrote the script, recorded and edited ourselves as the audio, and assembled the footage with in-app recordings and self-made animations. Every single aspect challenged us to do something out of our comfort zone. We were lucky to have a supportive community and friends that challenged us every step of the way.</p>\n<p>Now that we feel more confident because our closed alpha customers were satisfied, we are ready to show everyone what we got! That brings us to this preorder launch. We are looking to share more about this journey as we go, all the ups and downs. </p>\n<figure class=\"post__image\" ><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://www.typogram.co/blog/media/posts/11/emotionalJourney.png\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" srcset=\"https://www.typogram.co/blog/media/posts/11/responsive/emotionalJourney-xs.png 300w ,https://www.typogram.co/blog/media/posts/11/responsive/emotionalJourney-sm.png 480w ,https://www.typogram.co/blog/media/posts/11/responsive/emotionalJourney-md.png 768w ,https://www.typogram.co/blog/media/posts/11/responsive/emotionalJourney-lg.png 1024w\"  alt=\"\" width=\"1400\" height=\"896\">\n<figcaption ><em>source: <a href=\"https://x.company/blog/posts/the-monkey-the-tiger-beetle-and-the-language-of-innovation/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">x company Medium</a></em></figcaption>\n</figure>\n<h2>How can I support? </h2>\n<p>Launching a business is hard –– It would mean a lot to us if you could support us!</p>\n<p><em><strong>The best way to support is through pre-ordering our product.

This article primarily addresses pitch presentations since there is a significant focus on storytelling. The tips here can be helpful for other types of presentations as well. Consistent design and compelling storytelling can play a huge role in creating a powerful presentation.</p>\n<p><strong>These five rules can be good starting points:</strong></p>\n<ol>\n<li>Use images to tells a story</li>\n<li>Use appropriate fonts</li>\n<li>Add white space and be concise</li>\n<li>Use scale to help with delivery</li>\n<li>Create lasting impression by being consistent visually</li>\n</ol>\n<p><strong>Remember, presentation is storytelling. When you design a presentation, you are using visual language as a tool to tell the story.</strong></p>\n<hr>\n<h1 id=\"use-images-to-tells-a-story\">Use images to tells a story</h1>\n<p>A picture is worth a thousand words. Ask yourself these questions: </p>\n<ul>\n<li>What is the story of your presentation?</li>\n<li>What message or emotion do you want to leave the audience with?</li>\n<li>How can this specific slide help you in getting that message across?</li>\n<li>How can the image on that particular slide maximize this role?</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Once you figure out these questions, start searching for images. images that tell story about processes, illustrate pivotal moments, and associate with specific emotions are particularly helpful to presentations. If you want to learn more about how to visualize ideas, check out this <a href=\"https://www.typogram.co/blog/small-business-marketing-ideas/\">post</a>.</p>\n<p>A good tactic is using full bleed (edge to edge) images to illustrating pivotal moments, visions, impressive examples. It is more effective if the images are in high resolution.</p>\n<p><figure class=\"post__image\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://www.typogram.co/blog/media/posts/8/blogPost5Presentation1.png\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" srcset=\"https://www.typogram.co/blog/media/posts/8/responsive/blogPost5Presentation1-xs.png 300w ,https://www.typogram.co/blog/media/posts/8/responsive/blogPost5Presentation1-sm.png 480w ,https://www.typogram.co/blog/media/posts/8/responsive/blogPost5Presentation1-md.png 768w ,https://www.typogram.co/blog/media/posts/8/responsive/blogPost5Presentation1-lg.png 1024w\"  alt=\"leftCentervsFullBleed\" width=\"2024\" height=\"1012\" /></figure></p>\n<p>img: left- centered image on a slide; right- full bleed image. The full bleed image on the right will usually work better than on the left. It pulls in the audience a lot more since it is bigger in scale.</p>\n<hr>\n<h1 id=\"use-appropriate-fonts\">Use appropriate fonts</h1>\n<p>If you have a brand typography system, this can be an excellent place to use it. If you don’t know what font to use, choose Helvetica or a neutral serif, like <a href=\"https://fontdiscovery.typogram.co/p/fontdiscovery-13-plex-a-font-family\">Plex Sans</a> or <a href=\"https://fontdiscovery.typogram.co/p/fow-no4-libre-franklin-a-versatile?s=w\">Libre Franklin</a>.</p>\n<p>When you do a presentation, you want people to take you seriously. Display fonts generally are too decorative and distracting to use in a formal setting. You probably want to save your scripts and handwriting fonts for the presentation most of the time.</p>\n<p><figure class=\"post__image\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://www.typogram.co/blog/media/posts/8/blogPost5Presentation2.png\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" srcset=\"https://www.typogram.co/blog/media/posts/8/responsive/blogPost5Presentation2-xs.png 300w ,https://www.typogram.co/blog/media/posts/8/responsive/blogPost5Presentation2-sm.png 480w ,https://www.typogram.co/blog/media/posts/8/responsive/blogPost5Presentation2-md.png 768w ,https://www.typogram.co/blog/media/posts/8/responsive/blogPost5Presentation2-lg.png 1024w\"  alt=\"appropriateFont\" width=\"2024\" height=\"1012\" /></figure></p>\n<p>img: left- handwriting font is not appropriate for formal presentation. right- a fairly neutral sans serif is better suited and more clear.</p>\n<hr>\n<h1 id=\"improve-readability-by-adding-white-space\">Improve readability by adding white space</h1>\n<p>When you are creating a presentation, you are presenting a body of information clearly to your audience. An effective presentation is concise. This means shorter sentences, less text, and more white space. Considering adding space:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Between lines of text</li>\n<li>Between bullet point and text</li>\n<li>Between bullet point and bullet point</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If your text can breathe, the reader’s eyes can breathe.</p>\n<p>If a reader’s eyes can breathe, they will have an easier time understand and remember your story.</p>\n<p><figure class=\"post__image\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://www.typogram.co/blog/media/posts/8/blogPost5Presentation3.png\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" srcset=\"https://www.typogram.co/blog/media/posts/8/responsive/blogPost5Presentation3-xs.png 300w ,https://www.typogram.co/blog/media/posts/8/responsive/blogPost5Presentation3-sm.png 480w ,https://www.typogram.co/blog/media/posts/8/responsive/blogPost5Presentation3-md.png 768w ,https://www.typogram.co/blog/media/posts/8/responsive/blogPost5Presentation3-lg.png 1024w\"  alt=\"InformationWhitespace\" width=\"2024\" height=\"1012\" /></figure></p>\n<p>img: left- too much information and overcrowding. right- concise information with lots of white space create better readability.</p>\n<hr>\n<h1 id=\"use-scale-to-help-with-delivery\">Use scale to help with delivery</h1>\n<p>Scale is one of the most effective tools you can use to create dramatic visual imageries. If you want to emphasize a statement, consider making the sentence bigger on a separate slide because this creates anticipation and grabs attention. It is like a punch line.</p>\n<p><figure class=\"post__image\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://www.typogram.co/blog/media/posts/8/blogPost5Presentation4.png\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" srcset=\"https://www.typogram.co/blog/media/posts/8/responsive/blogPost5Presentation4-xs.png 300w ,https://www.typogram.co/blog/media/posts/8/responsive/blogPost5Presentation4-sm.png 480w ,https://www.typogram.co/blog/media/posts/8/responsive/blogPost5Presentation4-md.png 768w ,https://www.typogram.co/blog/media/posts/8/responsive/blogPost5Presentation4-lg.png 1024w\"  alt=\"typographyHierachy\" width=\"2024\" height=\"1012\" /></figure></p>\n<p>img: bigger text feels more impactful to audience.</p>\n<hr>\n<h1 id=\"create-lasting-impression-by-being-consistent-visually\">Create lasting impression by being consistent visually</h1>\n<p>In the end, your presentation is a visual document that tells a story about your ideas. The way it looks is the method you use to tell the story.</p>\n<p>When I make a presentation, I try to be consistent with how I show(design) the information on each slide. This means:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Use the same fonts for header and body texts.</li>\n<li>Keep the spacing between texts consistent.</li>\n<li>Keep track of all the different sizes of text you are using and stay consistent with text sizes between different levels of information.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Consistency will erase lots of needless frictions in your presentation, which will create more effective, straightforward storytelling.</p>\n<hr>\n<h1 id=\"phew-that-was-it\">Phew. That was it.</h1>\n<p>I hope this is helpful if you need to fundraise, or create presentations for work. Presentation is storytelling. If you master this well, it is a powerful skill that translates into many other areas.</p>\n",

I don’t have any ideas.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h2 id=\"initialize-your-ideas-and-turn-them-into-visuals\">Initialize your ideas and turn them into visuals</h2>\n<p>You have ideas. You just don’t know the best way to visualize it. Most of the time, when I visualize ideas, I start by writing things down.</p>\n<p>If it is my brand, the first thing I write down a mission or vision statement, then I write down a list of adjectives associated with this statement.</p>\n<p>For example, at Typogram, our statement is “empower everyone with design and creativity.”</p>\n<p><strong>First, I will write a couple of values that I want my brand to project to my customers visually.</strong></p>\n<p><em>Empowering, Creative, Fun</em></p>\n<p><strong>Then, I can go on Pinterest or any image discovery platform and start pulling together some images to create mood boards.</strong> Lots of people tend to skip this step, but it is super important. Building a mood board helps you build a style/ aesthetic library in your computer and mentally. I know it sounds a little magical, but it’s true. By making a mood board, you will better imagine what your brand can become, visually.</p>\n<hr>\n<h2 id=\"discover-and-expand-your-visuals\">Discover and expand your visuals</h2>\n<p>How do we build a mood board from each word? </p>\n<p>Consider each word from different angles (customer side, the business side, and so on).</p>\n<p><strong>Take the word <em>empowering</em>,  for example:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><p>What are some emotions associated with empowering?</p>\n<p>  Maybe Serious? Happiness? Warmth?</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>What are actions associated with empowering?</p>\n<p>  Maybe Protest? Diversity? Inclusion? Support Groups?</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Search on these terms on Pinterest and see what kind of images will come up.</p>\n<p><strong>You might see:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><em>Serious</em> → dark colors?</li>\n<li><em>Happiness</em> → pictures of smiling people,</li>\n<li><em>Warmth</em> → sunshine? Yellow, orange, warm colors?</li>\n<li><em>Protest</em> → protest poster art, bold fonts</li>\n</ul>\n<p>It could be images of people displaying emotions, landscapes, a specific texture, a particular color, a particular event that resonates with you. Choose the images you like and try to pin down the reason you choose a specific image.</p>\n<p>You can do this for a few terms. It’s good to have a collection of images (more than 20) for each board. That way, you can identify a running theme among images of within a board, like colors, styles, or aesthetics. This will give you some directions on color palettes, or look and feel of your brand.</p>\n<hr>\n<h2 id=\"collect-inspirations-and-turn-them-into-value\">Collect inspirations and turn them into value</h2>\n<p>Mood boards are an excellent resource for inspiration. In addition, it can serve as a collection of resources for your other visual content, such as blog posts, newsletter graphics, or social media posts. It is also a great reference document to hand off to a freelancer or an agency if you are working with one. When I worked at an agency, we feel relieved when clients give us mood boards because it shows us what they are thinking.</p>\n<p>Of course, this is my process. You can always do something different that works for you!</p>\n",

Here is a list of relevant terms and ideas for branding and design that could be helpful as you work through your design and marketing projects.</p>\n<h2 id=\"brand-identity\">Brand Identity</h2>\n<p>Brand identity is the visual aspect of a brand. Brand identity includes your logo, imagery, typography, colors, and creative assets. Together, these elements make your brand recognizable to your customers. Your brand identity is one of the most important parts when it comes to creating your brand.</p>\n<p><figure class=\"post__image\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://www.typogram.co/blog/media/posts/6/brandIdentity.gif\" alt=\"Brand Identity\" width=\"1600\" height=\"796\" /></figure></p>\n<h2 id=\"logo\">Logo</h2>\n<p>The logo is the piece of artwork that represents your brand. While a logo is only a single piece of artwork, it is used everywhere on your brand, like landing pages, social media for marketing, and ads. That’s why when you create your logo, you should think about its usability in different environments. There are times when you may have to display your logo in a small size. There might be times when your logo will end up in a dark background. Keeping those restrictions in mind at the beginning will save you troubles later on.</p>\n<p><figure class=\"post__image\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://www.typogram.co/blog/media/posts/6/logo.gif\" alt=\"Logo\" width=\"1600\" height=\"796\" /></figure></p>\n<h2 id=\"brand-color\">Brand Color</h2>\n<p>Brand color is the primary color associated with your brand. It can be on logos, business cards, decks, social media posts, websites, and other branding materials.</p>\n<p>It’s also the color your audience will associate your brand with. For example, Home Depot’s brand color is orange.</p>\n<p><figure class=\"post__image\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://www.typogram.co/blog/media/posts/6/brandColor.gif\" alt=\"Brand Color\" width=\"1600\" height=\"796\" /></figure></p>\n<h2 id=\"white-spacenegative-space\">White Space/Negative Space</h2>\n<p>White space, also called negative space, is the area that is left empty in design. It could be around the content or artwork(like a photo),  inside the content, or in-between two pieces of content. White space is crucial because it gives the elements in your design breathing room and provides ease for the viewer when they look at the information. Good use of white space also guides the audience’s eyes from one piece of content to the next, creating a hierarchy of information.</p>\n<h2 id=\"positive-space\">Positive Space</h2>\n<p>Positive space is the counterpart of negative space. The positive space is the space that the subject (this can be the content, or artwork) takes up.</p>\n<p><figure class=\"post__image\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://www.typogram.co/blog/media/posts/6/twitterNegativePositve.gif\" alt=\"Positive Space\" width=\"2222\" height=\"1108\" /></figure></p>\n<h2 id=\"design-composition\">Design Composition</h2>\n<p>Design composition is how design elements are placed on a page. Since elements are positive space and the unused space is negative space, we can also say that composition is the overall distribution of positive and negative spaces in the design.</p>\n<p>A general rule for creating good composition is to find balance between negative and positive space. When there is a lack of balance between negative and positive, there is tension. However, tension can also be explored to create powerful compositions. </p>\n<h2 id=\"design-grid\">Design Grid</h2>\n<p>Grids in design are systems for creating and organizing layouts. The layouts can be for print or screen. In design, “form follows function,” and layout is the perfect example of this. Different grids(layouts) suit different purposes.</p>\n<p><figure class=\"post__image\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://www.typogram.co/blog/media/posts/6/twitterDesignGrids.gif\" alt=\"Design Grid\" width=\"2222\" height=\"1108\" /></figure></p>\n<p>img: Different grids have different uses. </p>\n<h2 id=\"typography-system\">Typography System</h2>\n<p>Typography System is the combination of fonts and font styles that create your visual branding system. For example, you typically have corresponding fonts and font styles for headers, subheads, and body copy on the landing page. For branding, we will normally use the same typography system across most of the branding assets to create a consistent message.</p>\n<h2 id=\"typographic-hierarchy\">Typographic Hierarchy</h2>\n<p>Typographic hierarchy is the visual cue of scale and spatial relationship between the specific font styles. Typography hierarchy is crucial. It shows the audience which information is the most important and which is the least. For example, on your landing page, you probably want to capture the customers’ attention by first guiding them to the product’s unique value, then offer them a detailed description.</p>\n<p>To achieve this visually, you can make the header containing the copy for values of the product to be bigger and bolder in style than the detailed description of the product. That way, the eyes traveled to the header first, then to the description of the project.</p>\n<p><figure class=\"post__image\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://www.typogram.co/blog/media/posts/6/typographySystem.png\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" srcset=\"https://www.typogram.co/blog/media/posts/6/responsive/typographySystem-xs.png 300w ,https://www.typogram.co/blog/media/posts/6/responsive/typographySystem-sm.png 480w ,https://www.typogram.co/blog/media/posts/6/responsive/typographySystem-md.png 768w ,https://www.typogram.co/blog/media/posts/6/responsive/typographySystem-lg.png 1024w\"  alt=\"Typography System\" width=\"2024\" height=\"1012\" /></figure></p>\n<p><figure class=\"post__image\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://www.typogram.co/blog/media/posts/6/typographyHierachy.png\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" srcset=\"https://www.typogram.co/blog/media/posts/6/responsive/typographyHierachy-xs.png 300w ,https://www.typogram.co/blog/media/posts/6/responsive/typographyHierachy-sm.png 480w ,https://www.typogram.co/blog/media/posts/6/responsive/typographyHierachy-md.png 768w ,https://www.typogram.co/blog/media/posts/6/responsive/typographyHierachy-lg.png 1024w\"  alt=\"Typography Hierachy\" width=\"2024\" height=\"1012\" /></figure></p>\n<p>img: Information hierarchy is establish through scale relationship using fonts and font pairing.</p>\n<p><strong>Hopefully these can help you as you work on design projects for your startup!</strong> </p>\n<hr>\n<p>Do you have any additional questions or suggestions?  Let me know via Twitter <a href=\"https://twitter.com/typogramco\">@typogramco</a></p>\n",

You can answer the first question by researching your customers. The second question you can answer by using what you know about your customers and communicating your product’s unique values.</p>\n<h1 id=\"brand-identity-system\">Brand Identity System</h1>\n<p>Creative collaterals like logos, brand color, brand typeface are known as brand identity systems. The brand identity system is one of the essential parts of the branding process. It helps you think creatively and intentionally about communicating your brand visually to your customers while setting up a visual system for your brand message to stay consistent, trustworthy, and memorable.</p>\n<p><figure class=\"post__image\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://www.typogram.co/blog/media/posts/5/uber-4.png\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" srcset=\"https://www.typogram.co/blog/media/posts/5/responsive/uber-4-xs.png 300w ,https://www.typogram.co/blog/media/posts/5/responsive/uber-4-sm.png 480w ,https://www.typogram.co/blog/media/posts/5/responsive/uber-4-md.png 768w ,https://www.typogram.co/blog/media/posts/5/responsive/uber-4-lg.png 1024w\"  alt=\"Image description\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1125\" /></figure></p>\n<p>Do you have any additional questions or suggestions?  Let me know via Twitter <a href=\"https://twitter.com/typogramco\">@typogramco</a></p>\n",
