However, an unintended bug was introduced that may have caused issues with text layout when changing font size. If you’ve encountered these problems, we want to extend our deepest apologies. The bug has been fixed, and we invite you to try our tool again. We task ourselves to enhance your creative experience and hope you’ll enjoy the improved functionality and continue to explore the possibilities with our platform.</p>\n<h3 class=\"header-with-anchor-widget\"><strong>Feature №1: Importing Your Own Fonts</strong></h3>\n<p>Already know what font you want to use inside Typogram’s logo editor? Now you can! A much-requested feature, you can now import your own font inside Typogram. There are two convenient methods to import your own fonts from your computer into the design:</p>\n<p><strong>Method 1:</strong> within the font family drop-down menu, click on the “Add My Font Files” button. Then, use the file picker to select your fonts.</p>\n<figure class=\"post__image\" ><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://typogram.co/blog/media/posts/59/1-bring-your-own-fonts-file-button-2.gif\" alt=\"image: Click ‘Add My Font Files’ in the drop-down and choose your fonts with the file picker.\" width=\"800\" height=\"500\">\n<figcaption >image: Click ‘Add My Font Files’ in the drop-down and choose your fonts with the file picker.</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<div class=\"captioned-image-container\"> </div>\n<p><strong>Method 2:</strong> more conveniently, simply select any word or letter on the artboard and drag and drop the desired font file onto it!</p>\n<div class=\"captioned-image-container\">\n<figure>\n<div class=\"image2-inset\">\n<figure class=\"post__image\" ><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://typogram.co/blog/media/posts/59/2-bring-your-own-fonts-drop-files.gif\" alt=\"image: Drag and drop your chosen font file onto any text to apply it instantly on the artboard.\" width=\"1440\" height=\"900\">\n<figcaption >image: Drag and drop your chosen font file onto any text to apply it instantly on the artboard.</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<p>Rest assured, no font files are uploaded during this process; your font files remain local on your computer. After you’re finished using these fonts, you can choose to delete them.</p>\n</div>\n</figure>\n</div>\n<h3 class=\"header-with-anchor-widget\"><strong>Feature №2: Variable Fonts Support</strong></h3>\n<p>We’re excited to announce that we’ve added support for Variable Fonts! While we’re still in the process of enriching our font catalog with more variable fonts, you can now use your own variable fonts within our app.</p>\n<p>Variable Fonts offer endless granular control over font-weight, width, and other properties, unlocking a whole new realm of creative possibilities. This feature allows for unparalleled customization, enabling you to innovate with typography in ways never before possible. Dive into using Variable Fonts with our app and discover the vast potential for creativity in your projects.</p>\n<div class=\"captioned-image-container\">\n<figure>\n<div class=\"image2-inset\">\n<figure class=\"post__image\" ><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://typogram.co/blog/media/posts/59/3-variable-fonts-support-3.gif\" alt=\"image: Variable Fonts Support allows for precise adjustments of weight and other variable properties with an intuitive slider control.\" width=\"1440\" height=\"900\">\n<figcaption >image: Variable Fonts Support allows for precise adjustments of weight and other variable properties with an intuitive slider control.</figcaption>\n</figure>\n</div>\n<figcaption class=\"image-caption\"></figcaption>\n</figure>\n</div>\n<h3 class=\"header-with-anchor-widget\"><strong>Feature №3: Styling Text</strong></h3>\n<p>While this may not be the most glamorous feature, it’s a must-have. Previously, we emphasized granular control over each letter because we believe logo design needs this level of attention to detail. However, this focus shouldn’t overlook the convenience of being able to adjust a line of text together. It was previously possible by selecting all letters and styling them together; we’ve now made the process more user-friendly. Now, you can easily select a line of text and control its font family, style, and size all at once.</p>\n<div class=\"captioned-image-container\">\n<figure>\n<div class=\"image2-inset\"><picture><source type=\"image/webp\" srcset=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_lossy/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7f76e417-203b-42ae-a9a4-8f2996bff535_1440x900.gif 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_lossy/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7f76e417-203b-42ae-a9a4-8f2996bff535_1440x900.gif 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_lossy/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7f76e417-203b-42ae-a9a4-8f2996bff535_1440x900.gif 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_lossy/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7f76e417-203b-42ae-a9a4-8f2996bff535_1440x900.gif 1456w\" sizes=\"100vw\"></picture>\n<figure class=\"sizing-normal\" ><figure class=\"post__image\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  title=\"Manipulate text with direct control over font family, style, and size.\" src=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_lossy/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7f76e417-203b-42ae-a9a4-8f2996bff535_1440x900.gif\" data-is-external-image=\"true\"  sizes=\"100vw\" srcset=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_lossy/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7f76e417-203b-42ae-a9a4-8f2996bff535_1440x900.gif 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_lossy/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7f76e417-203b-42ae-a9a4-8f2996bff535_1440x900.gif 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_lossy/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7f76e417-203b-42ae-a9a4-8f2996bff535_1440x900.gif 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_lossy/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7f76e417-203b-42ae-a9a4-8f2996bff535_1440x900.gif 1456w\" alt=\"Manipulate text with direct control over font family, style, and size.\" width=\"1440\" height=\"900\" loading=\"lazy\" data-attrs=\"{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/7f76e417-203b-42ae-a9a4-8f2996bff535_1440x900.gif&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:900,&quot;width&quot;:1440,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:&quot;Manipulate text with direct control over font family, style, and size.&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null}\"></figure>\n<figcaption >image: Manipulate text with direct control over font family, style, and size.</figcaption>\n</figure>\n</div>\n<figcaption class=\"image-caption\"></figcaption>\n</figure>\n</div>\n<h3 class=\"header-with-anchor-widget\"><strong>Upcoming: Exclusive Premium Fonts!

How do you come up with a catchy name? What are the considerations? In this guide, we’ll explore the essential considerations for naming, how to come up with a good name, common pitfalls to avoid, and critical things to watch out for.</span></p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Before Naming Your Brand</span></h2>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Propose and Identity</span></h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Before you start brainstorming a potential brand name, it is vital to define the purpose and identity of your brand. What message or image do you want the name to convey? Understanding your brand’s purpose, essence, or unique selling point is essential. </span></p>\n<figure class=\"post__image\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://typogram.co/blog/media/posts/58/post34-howtomakeagreatproduct.png\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" srcset=\"https://typogram.co/blog/media/posts/58/responsive/post34-howtomakeagreatproduct-xs.png 300w ,https://typogram.co/blog/media/posts/58/responsive/post34-howtomakeagreatproduct-sm.png 480w ,https://typogram.co/blog/media/posts/58/responsive/post34-howtomakeagreatproduct-md.png 768w ,https://typogram.co/blog/media/posts/58/responsive/post34-howtomakeagreatproduct-lg.png 1024w\"  alt=\"\" width=\"2088\" height=\"1344\"></figure>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Target Audience </span></h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Who are you selling your brand to? Consider your target audience. Your name should resonate with your intended demographic. Think about what appeals to them and what kind of language they relate to. Research these words, phrases, and languages, and use them as inspirations. </span></p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Competition Research</span></h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It can be helpful to analyze your competitor’s names. You want a unique name that stands out and avoids confusion with similar businesses or products. Research will also help you identify naming trends within your industry, giving you additional naming ideas. </span></p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Process of Naming a Brand </span></h3>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Step 1: Create Your Seed Words</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Step 2: Identify a Naming Method</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Step 3: Still Stuck?

Where do I start? </span></p>\n</blockquote>\n<h2>Step 1: Create Your Seed Words</h2>\n<p><strong>You can start by developing a list of seed words describing what your product or business does. This can include: </strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">the business vertical that you are in (noun), </span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">what makes your brand unique (adjective) or how your customer would feel about this brand (adjective) </span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">abstractive words that are related to your business.</span></li>\n</ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For example, for a Travel Agency, this could look like: </span></p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Noun: Travel, Airline, Transportation, Air, Ticket, Booking, Hotel, Hospitality</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Adjective: Easy, Relaxed, Care-free, Adventurous, Luxurious</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Abstractive Words: Tranquility, Epiphany, Happiness, Destination</span></li>\n</ul>\n<hr>\n<h2>Step 2: Identify a Naming Method</h2>\n<p><strong>Choose one of our naming methods with your seed words. Experiment to make these words unique and ownable as a brand name.</strong></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It is hard to own “off-the-shelf” words like “Fast” and “Lovely” as brand names. They may associate with another brand already, and it could be tough for people to find your brand via search engines. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You need to spice up the word and make it unique, just like the “Distinctive Logo” step in Typogram, which spices up the logo to look visually distinctive and memorable. There are eight different Typogram methods to make a logo look unique. Below, we started collecting methods to make the words special as brand names.</span></p>\n<h4>Method 1:  Inventing words</h4>\n<h5>1.1 – Combine Noun and Adjective or Adverb</h5>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We can add adjective or adverb suffixes to make a new word from the noun. This newly invented word is more ownable as a brand since it is entirely original. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In addition, your audience can easily piece together what your new brand is based on the clue from your new brand name.</span></p>\n<p><em><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Examples: Grammarly, Typely, Typefully, Contentful, Shopify, Spotify</span></em></p>\n<figure class=\"post__image\" ><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://typogram.co/blog/media/posts/58/Naming-InventingWords.png\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" srcset=\"https://typogram.co/blog/media/posts/58/responsive/Naming-InventingWords-xs.png 300w ,https://typogram.co/blog/media/posts/58/responsive/Naming-InventingWords-sm.png 480w ,https://typogram.co/blog/media/posts/58/responsive/Naming-InventingWords-md.png 768w ,https://typogram.co/blog/media/posts/58/responsive/Naming-InventingWords-lg.png 1024w\"  alt=\"Method 1.1 - transform the noun into an adjective, adverb, or verb, and vice versa\" width=\"1859\" height=\"1132\">\n<figcaption ><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Method 1.1 - Transform the noun into an adjective, adverb, or verb, and vice versa</span></figcaption>\n</figure>\n<figure class=\"post__image\" ><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://typogram.co/blog/media/posts/58/Adverb-Adjective-Suffixes.png\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" srcset=\"https://typogram.co/blog/media/posts/58/responsive/Adverb-Adjective-Suffixes-xs.png 300w ,https://typogram.co/blog/media/posts/58/responsive/Adverb-Adjective-Suffixes-sm.png 480w ,https://typogram.co/blog/media/posts/58/responsive/Adverb-Adjective-Suffixes-md.png 768w ,https://typogram.co/blog/media/posts/58/responsive/Adverb-Adjective-Suffixes-lg.png 1024w\"  alt=\"some examples of suffixes you can add to nouns\" width=\"1332\" height=\"842\">\n<figcaption ><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Examples of suffixes you can add to nouns</span></figcaption>\n</figure>\n<h5>1.2 – Combine Two Words into a Single One </h5>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You can also invent words by creating a portmanteau, combining two words from your seed list into one name. Your new brand name should have less than four syllables so it is easy for someone to pronounce, remember, and share in a conversation. </span></p>\n<p><em><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Examples: Starbucks(Beverage), Facebook(Tech), and Activia (Food).</span></em></p>\n<figure class=\"post__image\" ><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://typogram.co/blog/media/posts/58/Naming-CombinigTwoWords.png\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" srcset=\"https://typogram.co/blog/media/posts/58/responsive/Naming-CombinigTwoWords-xs.png 300w ,https://typogram.co/blog/media/posts/58/responsive/Naming-CombinigTwoWords-sm.png 480w ,https://typogram.co/blog/media/posts/58/responsive/Naming-CombinigTwoWords-md.png 768w ,https://typogram.co/blog/media/posts/58/responsive/Naming-CombinigTwoWords-lg.png 1024w\"  alt=\"method 1.2 - combine two words into a single one\" width=\"1857\" height=\"670\">\n<figcaption ><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Method 1.2 - combine two words into a single one</span></figcaption>\n</figure>\n<h5>1.3 - Combine a Partial Word and a Word</h5>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Similar to combining two words, this method joins two name ideas together, but with a twist. Incorporating a partial word, usually a word root, like -gram or insta-, allows us to present two ideas in a much shorter format. </span></p>\n<figure class=\"post__image\" ><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://typogram.co/blog/media/posts/58/Naming-CombiningPartialWordandWord.png\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" srcset=\"https://typogram.co/blog/media/posts/58/responsive/Naming-CombiningPartialWordandWord-xs.png 300w ,https://typogram.co/blog/media/posts/58/responsive/Naming-CombiningPartialWordandWord-sm.png 480w ,https://typogram.co/blog/media/posts/58/responsive/Naming-CombiningPartialWordandWord-md.png 768w ,https://typogram.co/blog/media/posts/58/responsive/Naming-CombiningPartialWordandWord-lg.png 1024w\"  alt=\"img: Instagram, Instabase, Ubisoft, Microsoft, Netflix, Skype\" width=\"1857\" height=\"670\">\n<figcaption ><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Method 1.3 - Instagram, Instabase, Ubisoft, Microsoft, Netflix, Skype</span></figcaption>\n</figure>\n<p> </p>\n<h5>1.4 – Shorten Words </h5>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sometimes, it is better to subtract than to add. You can invent a brand new, shorter word by shortening a longer word into a shorter one or isolating parts of a longer word. For example, Fanta originated from the longer German word, <em>Fantastisch</em>, meaning fantastic. “Pepsi” was initially advertised to relieve dyspepsia. </span></p>\n<p><em><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Example: Fanta (Beverage), Pepsi(Beverage)</span></em></p>\n<figure class=\"post__image\" ><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://typogram.co/blog/media/posts/58/Naming-ShortenWords.png\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" srcset=\"https://typogram.co/blog/media/posts/58/responsive/Naming-ShortenWords-xs.png 300w ,https://typogram.co/blog/media/posts/58/responsive/Naming-ShortenWords-sm.png 480w ,https://typogram.co/blog/media/posts/58/responsive/Naming-ShortenWords-md.png 768w ,https://typogram.co/blog/media/posts/58/responsive/Naming-ShortenWords-lg.png 1024w\"  alt=\"img - shortened fanta\" width=\"1857\" height=\"900\">\n<figcaption >Fanta is a great example that uses a shortened word as brand name</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<h4>Method 2: Misspelled Words</h4>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You can create a brand name by creating a misspelled word by adding, omitting, or substituting one or two letters from an essential word to your brand. Your addition, omission, or substitution should be small, so the original word can still be partially seen and understood. </span></p>\n<p><em><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Example: Sunkist (Beverage), Lyft (Transportation)</span></em></p>\n<p><em><strong>Special Tip: Remove “non-essential” letters in the word, such as vowels.</strong></em></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This method is so widely used that it has become a trend. Some vowel letters, especially the letter ‘e’, are very insignificant in terms of pronunciation, so why not drop them? The minimalist approach transforms an everyday word into a unique brand name without changing the pronunciation (for the most part). </span></p>\n<p><em><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Example: Flickr, Rdio, Tumblr, Scribd, Pixlr, GVE</span></em></p>\n<figure class=\"post__image\" ><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://typogram.co/blog/media/posts/58/Naming-MisspelledWords.png\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" srcset=\"https://typogram.co/blog/media/posts/58/responsive/Naming-MisspelledWords-xs.png 300w ,https://typogram.co/blog/media/posts/58/responsive/Naming-MisspelledWords-sm.png 480w ,https://typogram.co/blog/media/posts/58/responsive/Naming-MisspelledWords-md.png 768w ,https://typogram.co/blog/media/posts/58/responsive/Naming-MisspelledWords-lg.png 1024w\"  alt=\"deleting letters\" width=\"1857\" height=\"900\">\n<figcaption >Deleting letters</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<h4>Method 3: Real Words </h4>\n<p><strong>Real words</strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> are actual words used in real life. When using real words, it is vital to think about whether it could optimized for the search engine. Unless you have a lot of money, a brand name like “Smile” is challenging to own because many other research results are already associated with the keyword “Smile”. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Another way to consider real words is by using a suffix as a brand name. For example, Uber is a brand using the German suffix Über-, meaning over or beyond, as its brand name. It’s short, easy to pronounce and remember, and makes it easy to create sub-brands. </span></p>\n<p><em><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Examples: Uber (Transportation), Patagonia (Retail), Sprite(Beverage), Better (mortgage), and Mint (Telecommuting). </span></em></p>\n<figure class=\"post__image\" ><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://typogram.co/blog/media/posts/58/Naming-RealWord-2.png\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" srcset=\"https://typogram.co/blog/media/posts/58/responsive/Naming-RealWord-2-xs.png 300w ,https://typogram.co/blog/media/posts/58/responsive/Naming-RealWord-2-sm.png 480w ,https://typogram.co/blog/media/posts/58/responsive/Naming-RealWord-2-md.png 768w ,https://typogram.co/blog/media/posts/58/responsive/Naming-RealWord-2-lg.png 1024w\"  alt=\"Real word branding name example\" width=\"1857\" height=\"900\">\n<figcaption ><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Real word branding name example</span></figcaption>\n</figure>\n<h4>Method 4: Paired Words </h4>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Another way to generate brand names is by pairing two words. </span></p>\n<p><em><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Examples: AllTrails (Outdoor), Care Bear(Toy), and Dr.Peper (Beverage).</span></em></p>\n<figure class=\"post__image\" ><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://typogram.co/blog/media/posts/58/Naming-PairedWords.png\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" srcset=\"https://typogram.co/blog/media/posts/58/responsive/Naming-PairedWords-xs.png 300w ,https://typogram.co/blog/media/posts/58/responsive/Naming-PairedWords-sm.png 480w ,https://typogram.co/blog/media/posts/58/responsive/Naming-PairedWords-md.png 768w ,https://typogram.co/blog/media/posts/58/responsive/Naming-PairedWords-lg.png 1024w\"  alt=\"img: paired words\" width=\"1857\" height=\"670\">\n<figcaption ><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Paired words</span></figcaption>\n</figure>\n<h4>Method 5: Create an Acronym </h4>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Creating </span><strong>acronyms</strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> from words is also a popular method for generating brand names.

Jeremy Miller’s Namescape is an excellent tool for this exact purpose. Namescape helps you craft a brand name based on two axes: </span></p>\n<ol>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Structure of the words</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Types of Names</span></li>\n</ol>\n<h4>Structure of Words </h4>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Using our identified methods, you can consider different word structures for creating your brand name, such as real, paired, invented, acronyms, or misspelled words. </span></p>\n<h4>Types of Names</h4>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You can also think about types of names, like descriptive, suggestive, and abstract. Descriptive names, like Mountain Dew, conjure up images and feelings. Suggestive names, like Petco, hint at what a product or service will do. Completely abstract names with memorable sounds, like Figma (Design tool), are easy to share in conversations. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You can create a naming matrix by placing the words’ structure on one side and the types of names on the other. Next, try to come up with names that meet both requirements. It can be helpful to create namescapes of your competitors to analyze naming trends in your industry, helping you generate brand name ideas. </span></p>\n<figure class=\"post__image\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://typogram.co/blog/media/posts/58/NamingMatrix.png\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" srcset=\"https://typogram.co/blog/media/posts/58/responsive/NamingMatrix-xs.png 300w ,https://typogram.co/blog/media/posts/58/responsive/NamingMatrix-sm.png 480w ,https://typogram.co/blog/media/posts/58/responsive/NamingMatrix-md.png 768w ,https://typogram.co/blog/media/posts/58/responsive/NamingMatrix-lg.png 1024w\"  alt=\"\" width=\"1600\" height=\"840\"></figure>\n<hr>\n<h2>Step 4 : Test Your Name</h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Once you have a list of potential names, test them with your target audience, friends, or family. Their feedback can be invaluable and help you catch things you didn’t think of before. </span></p>\n<hr>\n<h2>Don’ts for Naming</h2>\n<h5>Avoid Trends</h5>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Trendy names can quickly become outdated. Opt for a timeless and enduring name that won’t require frequent rebranding.</span></p>\n<h5>Complex Spellings</h5>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Complicated or unusual spellings can confuse customers and make it harder for them to find you online. Keep it simple.</span></p>\n<h5>Negative Connotations</h5>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Be mindful of cultural, linguistic, or regional associations that may have negative connotations. A seemingly innocent name might have unintended meanings in other languages or cultures.</span></p>\n<h5>Overused Words</h5>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Avoid overused words like “innovative,” “solutions,” or “global” in your brand name unless they genuinely represent your brand’s essence.</span></p>\n<hr>\n<h2>Things to Watch Out For</h2>\n<h5>Legal Issues &amp; Trademarks</h5>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Before you decide on a brand name, conduct a thorough search to avoid potential complications. Is the brand name already trademarked? Is there a company or product that already has that brand name? Ensure your chosen name is unique and not already trademarked. Trademark infringement can lead to legal issues and rebranding costs. </span></p>\n<h5>Domain Availability</h5>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ensure that a matching domain name is available. Your online presence is essential, and a matching domain can make a significant difference.</span></p>\n<h5>Scalability</h5>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Consider the long-term. Will your chosen name still make sense if your business or product expands or diversifies?</span></p>\n<h5>Cultural Sensitivity</h5>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Be aware of cultural and social sensitivities. A name that might be harmless in one context could be offensive in another.</span></p>\n<hr>\n<h2>Naming in an Art</h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In conclusion, naming is an art that requires careful consideration. It’s not just about choosing a word; it’s about creating an identity. Take your time, and involve others in the process. A well-thought-out name can only help. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After sketching out names, you can experiment with the names visually. You can explore this through our Brand Personality workshop or start sketching them out inside Typogram!</span></p>",

            "content_html": "<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Happy New Year! Recently, we launched the latest version of Typogram on Product Hunt. Our main goals for this launch were deliver our latest product before 2023 ends and experiment with our launch strategy. We want to devise a marketing plan to maximize our product growth during this launch period. Our solution was a month-long marketing campaign, with a product hunt launch as a culminating event. Now that the launch has ended, we want to share our tips and learnings for this launch in this post. </span></p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Quick Stats for Launch Day </span></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Here are some quick stats for day of the launch:</span></p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Build in Public Newsletter subscriber + 10</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">+ 262 registered users the week of the launch</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">3 sales on the day of launch (with more sales before and after the launch during the sales window)</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">No.8 product of the day - Our peak position was No.2</span></li>\n</ul>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Helpful Strategies </span></h2>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">No.1: Marketing Idea Bank</span></h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To help us quickly come up with things to share and promote during the weeks before launch, we create an idea bank for content. For each week, we identified a theme/ idea we wanted to share around our launch. We then searched our content library of relevant posts and visuals and developed them into tweets. This aimed to grow our newsletter subscribers and reach on Twitter.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">By the end, we gained the most followers on Twitter. In comparison, the newsletter grew less in subscribers. This could be because Twitter’s algorithm deprioritizes tweets with links, especially Substack links. Looking back, the idea bank is a tool I will keep implementing because it makes marketing easy. Like most introverts, I struggle with finding things to say on social media, especially regarding sales and marketing. In the future, I want to develop an idea bank for every single marketing event. </span></p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">No.2: Running a month-long sale during the launch day</span></h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We previously ran a sale on the Product Hunt platform on launch day. This time, we ran two parallel sales – one on our own and one through a Lifetime Deals Facebook group. The price for the basic tier (our single-brand lifetime license ) was the same for both sales, and we ran both sales for about a month. Our (own) campaign performed well and generated several sales weeks before and after the launch. The promo at the Facebook group was interesting and gave us several paid customers who ordered multiple licenses. I will share more about our experience and learning with the LTD Facebook group channel in a separate post. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Overall, running a sales campaign parallel to the launch was a good move. It helped us talk about our product a lot more. Next time, I want to experiment with a shorter sales window, like a two-week sale, rather than a monthly long sale, especially for the LTD group. </span></p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Highlights from Launch</span></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The launch day was a day full of ups and downs. The launch’s best part is seeing our community’s love and support, which can't be measured in numbers. Here are some top highlights.</span></p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">No.1 – Tofu is loved</span></h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Throughout the launch, Tofu was liked and tweeted many times. Her face was seeing 11.4k times around Twitter. I think she may be a nano influencer now. 😁</span></p>\n<figure ><figure class=\"post__image centerBlogPostImage\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/m3rmIoHGbBx4ek4byLaYrID8veQ0PbRbd0GsOgzZzUkrLwRv1Xq6QTyKFsmv8bso1fBIKpBicJa8bnEDGTT_3oopBYUU6SYICPBMbUJrO54s6-FNhBie99j-uFFG4Rm5IedNsRiDBAf4UegyuXu_25g\" data-is-external-image=\"true\"  alt=\"Tofu working hard\" width=\"422\" height=\"801\"></figure>\n<figcaption >Tofu working hard</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">No.2 – We got so much love on the launch day!</span></h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Our launch page on Product Hunt was flooded with love, helpful feedback, and suggestions. ❤️.</span></p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/LKqZrm_tmj_0F5R18ltaiCcNu0fs6wSM_2YZcsD0CkzQw8gF1yZ251H9_HKaYpNrxCHQCVZC7ne64ISbepqhGfuqJSIX88hGRUcM818JJYNXr4dFXqXeuAidswD3Tjho47GsD8rnPogcYtvS9tfE7VM\" data-is-external-image=\"true\" ></p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br></span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">No.3 – We have the most passionate users</span></h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Check out Frank’s video reviewing Typogram!</span></p>\n<figure class=\"post__video\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" width=\"560\" height=\"314\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/DoS19uMBhqM\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" data-mce-fragment=\"1\"></iframe></figure>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Final Words </span></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We are so thankful to our users and community for supporting us thus far.

We realize PH launches can be a vehicle instead of a single event. Instead of considering the PH launch as the solitary main event, we could see it as the culminating event. That way, we can grow and build hype around the product in multiple ways.</p>\n<div class=\"pullquote\">\n<p>You can <a href=\"https://www.producthunt.com/products/typogram\">follow</a> our actions here! 🚀</p>\n</div>\n<p><strong>So, we are trying a new experiment. </strong></p>\n<h3 class=\"header-with-anchor-widget\">First Three Weeks</h3>\n<p>Rather than promoting intensely for two weeks right before and concentrating solely on the launch event, we have been promoting the whole month, with the first three weeks centered on broadening our reach. We created a content bank from our previous blog posts and newsletter issues. We then crafted tweets, posts, and graphics and scheduled them on our Twitter accounts. We are focusing on: </p>\n<ul>\n<li>Grow subscribers for our build-in-public newsletter <br><br></li>\n<li>Gain free account users and increase exposure to Typogram<br><br></li>\n<li>Increase our Twitter audience before the launch to maximize reach</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 class=\"header-with-anchor-widget\">Final Week</h3>\n<p>In the final week, we’ll focus more intensely on Product Hunt, utilizing methods we learned from previous launches. </p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Gather the support of our friends from different time zones </p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Get active on product hunt community forums </p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Mystery launch photoshoot (this is something fun we are doing- can’t wait to share with you more)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Launch exclusive post with call the action to PH launch soon page </p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 class=\"header-with-anchor-widget\">How is it going?</h3>\n<p>We are in the third week, and We’ve been scheduling and posting tweets. So far, it’s working great. I've been getting more active on Twitter, and now working on Reddit. Next week, I'll start doing more behind-the-scenes work exclusively for the launch. </p>\n<p> </p>",

We’ve made countless improvements and bug fixes. A few major ones: </p>\n<h4>Improving Overall User Experience</h4>\n<p>This overhaul was not merely a switch but a journey where we painstakingly crushed reported bugs, resolved technical debt, and discovered more efficient ways to execute, all aimed at enhancing the quality of Typogram for our users. Our new app, now optimized for performance and rendering, effectively addressed and resolved many previous issues, such as font loading and rendering.</p>\n<h4>Complete Rework of Redo-Undo Feature</h4>\n<p>We completely rebuilt this feature and fixed the “ghost artboard flashback” issue. Also, by switching the data storage method, the feature can now handle a much longer edit history, allowing you to go way back in artboard history if you ever find regrets in your design journey.</p>\n<h4>Brand New Login Page</h4>\n<p>Our new modular code base has significantly enhanced our development process, enabling us to add new features more easily and quickly. </p>\n<p>Previously, we used a pre-packaged login page, which occasionally had users stuck in an infinite login loop. We didn’t have control over this external code to fix the bug. With our new custom login page, we have now resolved the issue. It is more reliable, beautiful, and has nice user experience details. </p>\n<div class=\"captioned-image-container\">\n<figure>\n<div class=\"image2-inset\"><picture><source type=\"image/webp\" srcset=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_lossy/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ffaafd2b7-63b6-41f6-a236-f779cff1e65d_1440x900.gif 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_lossy/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ffaafd2b7-63b6-41f6-a236-f779cff1e65d_1440x900.gif 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_lossy/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ffaafd2b7-63b6-41f6-a236-f779cff1e65d_1440x900.gif 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_lossy/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ffaafd2b7-63b6-41f6-a236-f779cff1e65d_1440x900.gif 1456w\" sizes=\"100vw\"></picture>\n<figure class=\"sizing-normal\" ><figure class=\"post__image\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_lossy/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ffaafd2b7-63b6-41f6-a236-f779cff1e65d_1440x900.gif\" data-is-external-image=\"true\"  sizes=\"100vw\" srcset=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_lossy/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ffaafd2b7-63b6-41f6-a236-f779cff1e65d_1440x900.gif 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_lossy/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ffaafd2b7-63b6-41f6-a236-f779cff1e65d_1440x900.gif 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_lossy/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ffaafd2b7-63b6-41f6-a236-f779cff1e65d_1440x900.gif 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_lossy/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ffaafd2b7-63b6-41f6-a236-f779cff1e65d_1440x900.gif 1456w\" alt=\"Gif: Auto-direct to Sign Up or Sign In based on your account status\" width=\"1440\" height=\"900\" data-attrs=\"{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/faafd2b7-63b6-41f6-a236-f779cff1e65d_1440x900.gif&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:900,&quot;width&quot;:1440,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:&quot;https://typogram.co/sign-in&quot;,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:false,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null}\"></figure>\n<figcaption ><em>Gif: Auto-direct to Sign Up or Sign In based on your account status</em></figcaption>\n</figure>\n</div>\n<figcaption class=\"image-caption\"></figcaption>\n</figure>\n</div>\n<h4>Better Free Plan</h4>\n<p>Another major update: We are making Typogram easier to try and recommend.

Once you are used to the user interface, the editor is intuitive and allows you to create automation flows between different apps. I use Make to set up part of the payment system for Typogram.

We offered a discounted lifetime deal for a single-brand license for this pre-order. Users can edit their logo forever inside our app as long as it's for the same brand. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At this point, we have yet to complete coding for the entire tool, like account management and payment.

We have been successful with content marketing and Engineering as marketing for growth. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Write content your potential new users will like.

I highly recommend this strategy because you are not tied to the platform, and you can start creating a community and finding supporters immediately.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Typogram has two weekly newsletters: a </span><a href=\"https://build.typogram.co/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">built-in public newsletter</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> about our startup journey and </span><a href=\"https://fontdiscovery.typogram.co/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">a design newsletter</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, sharing beginner-friendly tips for typography, branding, and logo design. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In our newsletters, we share our startup journey. We also find topics to write about by researching what our users are interested in through Reddit. Initially, I was worried I couldn't maintain the consistency required for newsletters. Most days, it was easy to come up with topics to write about. Writing to an audience also helped me stay motivated. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Strategies for growing the newsletters include sharing on relevant communities, like Reddit, Indiehackers, and Twitter, and cross-promotion with other newsletters.</span></p>\n<h4><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Reddit</span></h4>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Reddit is an excellent place filled with communities of all sorts of interests. A proud Redditor since 2010s, Reddit is my preferred platform. Redditors hate spamming, and mods can permanently ban you from the site if you break the rules of their communities. In most subreddits, you will find rules on the right-hand side specifying community rules. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The most efficient way to market on Reddit is to ask for feedback about my project and focus on being helpful. Another useful technique is to filter posts by \"Hot\" and look at what topics people have written about that the followers of the subreddits already liked. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You can then use these as prompts to create your content and posts. Lastly, you can be helpful in the comments and subtly plug your products. Comments are less moderated. </span></p>\n<h4><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Power-up: F5Bot</span></h4>\n<p><a href=\"https://f5bot.com/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">F5Bot</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> is a fantastic, free resource that helps you level up your Reddit game by allowing you to track keywords on those platforms. You will get posts with targeted keywords delivered to your inbox. I primarily use this tool to understand and engage with my potential users in the startup communities.</span></p>\n<h4><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Secret Hack</span></h4>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It is possible to become a moderator of an abandoned subreddit. Many subreddits (anywhere from under 100 to over 10k in size) have inactive moderators. If you have enough karma points, you can apply to be a mod for inactive communities. Though you will have to perform extra labor of monitoring content, it could be very effective if it's in your niche.</span></p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Engineering as Marketing </span></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Engineering as Marketing can be more costly than other growth tactics in the short term, utilizing more time and effort in a concentrated block of time. However, if your engineering as marketing project takes off, you get a great new digital real estate, a nice traffic boost, and even SEO benefits. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For example, we launched </span><a href=\"https://codingfont.com/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Coding Font</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> as an Engineering as Marketing project for Typogram. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Because many potential users for Typogram are web devs and people who spent a lot of time in IDE, we wanted to create a fun little website where they could find their dream coding font. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When we launched Coding Font on Product Hunt, we got </span><a href=\"https://build.typogram.co/p/stats-of-coding-font-launch\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">​​22,000 visits on launch day</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. Coding Font was featured on the front page of Hackernews and on blogs like <a href=\"https://boingboing.net/2021/10/27/click-your-way-to-your-favorite-monospace-font.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">BoingBoing</a> and <a href=\"https://css-tricks.com/coding-font-game/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">CSS Tricks</a>, improving its backlink profile and site ranking. We seized this opportunity to add blog content and keywords to this site. As a result, we got newsletter sign-ups, sales, and continuous referral traffic. </span></p>\n<figure class=\"post__image\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/4HCXr-QG3213ko9g6RkGap8KZiuSWeAmolfxeDYRjEXnk4iFzvyW1GlKM8FmodSo4-LwbQvcmHJEJVqjfBaQ5LC2pugQNTAGE8sXrVHqJgRgx2o24GtlcYepXI6eC7Fk2OuIFQZuNCz6lpvL-AfATu4\" data-is-external-image=\"true\"  alt=\"Our most successful engineering as marketing game, Coding Font\"><figcaption>Our most successful engineering as marketing game, Coding Font</figcaption></figure>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Long-Term Growth: </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">SEO/Organic Traffic via Long-Tail Keywords </span></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">SEO gets a bad rep from email spam by link-building agencies, but it's one of the best ways to </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">gain free traffic and attract potential users to your site. The most important thing about SEO: it takes time to develop and grow. Once we validated ideas for Typogram, we started paying closer attention to SEO and how we can leverage SEO to increase organic traffic. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You can target long tail keywords, which are three to five words long search queries. Long tails are usually more niche, less search volume, and less competitive. For example, we have the </span><a href=\"https://typogram.co/font-discovery\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">FontDiscovery(our design newsletter) archive</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> for Typogram for our long tail search queries. These posts give us a nice traffic boost, over 1k per month. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I highly recommend Ahrefs' YouTube lessons. Please force yourself to watch them. You won't regret it, and you might even like it.</span></p>\n<figure class=\"post__image\" ><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://typogram.co/blog/media/posts/53/Font-Discovery-Blog.png\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" srcset=\"https://typogram.co/blog/media/posts/53/responsive/Font-Discovery-Blog-xs.png 300w ,https://typogram.co/blog/media/posts/53/responsive/Font-Discovery-Blog-sm.png 480w ,https://typogram.co/blog/media/posts/53/responsive/Font-Discovery-Blog-md.png 768w ,https://typogram.co/blog/media/posts/53/responsive/Font-Discovery-Blog-lg.png 1024w\"  alt=\"FontDiscovery archive \" width=\"1600\" height=\"1060\">\n<figcaption >FontDiscovery archive </figcaption>\n</figure>\n<figure class=\"post__image\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/0oEpakJ6_ybu613hMTE9vv9Q7Ul38vt8Zxi_3G4C6ImgzWDxWvO9uGMKNmRpumCRNnXfHHJoBQDAKViQRZtXVum9eotgwRLUAyLGV2mEuDqWFejS3o_0xSld9h5Cv3zWtuv_rGM9dFrF_mHUlyi_O4A\" data-is-external-image=\"true\"  alt=\"Some promising results from long tail keywords\"><figcaption>Promising results from long tail keywords</figcaption></figure>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Last Words </span></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">My last words are about ads.

Here is what we've working on this month!</p>\n<h2 class=\"header-with-anchor-widget\"><strong>Modularizing Brand Personality</strong></h2>\n<p>During our <a href=\"https://typogram.co/blog/typogram-product-updates-no12-in-app-tutorial-videos-streamlined-brand-name-change-modularized-app-components/\" title=\"typogram product update\">last product update</a>, we shared about our new product thinking: modular steps and shareable work-in-progress. We are making Typogram more modular, making workflow between steps more flexible, and design work more shareable. </p>\n<p>In the last few weeks, we have been working on modularizing the Brand Personality Step. I’ve been (Wenting) making two big changes to Typogram, starting with the brand personality step. </p>\n<h3 class=\"header-with-anchor-widget\"><strong>Changing the Base</strong></h3>\n<p>I initially built Typogram using a javascript framework called Vue. To improve the user experience, I changed the base of Typogram to Svelte. Svelte pre-renders our app and eliminates the need for loading additional JavaScript files, which our previous framework, Vue, lacked. This change will help our app run faster, improving the overall experience!</p>\n<h3 class=\"header-with-anchor-widget\"><strong>Making Parts &amp; Adding Share</strong></h3>\n<p>I’ve also been “modularizing” our app, splitting the app into smaller parts. Modularizing Typogram allows the potential for less linear workflows for users (a popular request ), makes things neater and easier to manage, and makes it possible to reuse the parts to create mini standalone apps for steps like Brand Personality. </p>\n<p>Here is a sneak peek of what I’ve added to the Brand Personality step – sharable social (Instagram) post that you can create and customize to share and test drive your designs immediately with your audience.</p>\n<div class=\"captioned-image-container\">\n<figure>\n<div class=\"image2-inset\"><picture><source type=\"image/webp\" srcset=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_lossy/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1a874421-2a25-44ad-aef5-0cd6431a6df8_538x593.gif 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_lossy/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1a874421-2a25-44ad-aef5-0cd6431a6df8_538x593.gif 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_lossy/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1a874421-2a25-44ad-aef5-0cd6431a6df8_538x593.gif 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_lossy/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1a874421-2a25-44ad-aef5-0cd6431a6df8_538x593.gif 1456w\" sizes=\"100vw\"></picture>\n<figure class=\"sizing-normal\" ><figure class=\"post__image\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  title=\"image: The sharable graphics can be customized with different color themes\" src=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_lossy/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1a874421-2a25-44ad-aef5-0cd6431a6df8_538x593.gif\" data-is-external-image=\"true\"  sizes=\"100vw\" srcset=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_lossy/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1a874421-2a25-44ad-aef5-0cd6431a6df8_538x593.gif 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_lossy/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1a874421-2a25-44ad-aef5-0cd6431a6df8_538x593.gif 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_lossy/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1a874421-2a25-44ad-aef5-0cd6431a6df8_538x593.gif 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_lossy/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1a874421-2a25-44ad-aef5-0cd6431a6df8_538x593.gif 1456w\" alt=\"image: The sharable graphics can be customized with different color themes\" width=\"930\" height=\"1037\" loading=\"lazy\" data-attrs=\"{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/1a874421-2a25-44ad-aef5-0cd6431a6df8_538x593.gif&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:593,&quot;width&quot;:538,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:&quot;image: The sharable graphics can be customized with different color themes&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null}\"></figure>\n<figcaption >image: The sharable graphics can be customized with different color themes</figcaption>\n</figure>\n</div>\n</figure>\n</div>\n<p>You can customize the colors of the post as well as the styles.

Don’t know how to start with fonts, color, and typography systems for your brand? Do not worry. We got you back! </p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Today we introduce one of our favorite tools we’ve created: <a href=\"https://workshop.typogram.co/\" title=\"Typogram’s Brand Personality Workshop Kit\">Typogram’s Brand Personality Workshop Kit</a>. Our branding workshop kit is made for folks with little to no marketing and branding design experience and is a fun activity that will help you start thinking creatively about your company. By following the three-step exercise in our free workshop kit, you will walk away with brand personalities and visual directions for your company, giving you ideas to build your brand designs: logos, fonts, colors, and typography systems.</p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What is brand personality? </span></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Inside Typogram, the first thing you complete is figuring out your brand personality. A brand is a person’s feeling about a product, a service, or a company. A brand personality is a “personality” or human characteristics we can assign to a brand. You can influence how people feel about your brand by creating a brand personality and then communicating the brand personality visually through the brand’s design directions, like fonts, logos, typography, colors, and imagery.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It can be overwhelming to start figuring out your brand personality, especially if you have no marketing background or have never thought about branding that way. Therefore, we created a fun, interactive workshop kit to help you identify your brand personality. </span></p>\n<figure class=\"post__image\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://typogram.co/blog/media/posts/50/brandPersonality.png\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" srcset=\"https://typogram.co/blog/media/posts/50/responsive/brandPersonality-xs.png 300w ,https://typogram.co/blog/media/posts/50/responsive/brandPersonality-sm.png 480w ,https://typogram.co/blog/media/posts/50/responsive/brandPersonality-md.png 768w ,https://typogram.co/blog/media/posts/50/responsive/brandPersonality-lg.png 1024w\"  alt=\"what is a brand \" width=\"1600\" height=\"900\"></figure>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What is inside our Brand Personality Workshop Kit?  </span></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This kit contains: </span></p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Explanation worksheets with interactive exercises help you understand and identify brand personality</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Custom brand personality cards with visual examples </span></li>\n</ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">By completing the three-step exercise in our workshop kit, you will learn, eliminate and finalize a chosen five top brand personalities, serving as visual directions and inspirations for your brand. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This workshop kit can accommodate a solopreneur or a small team of founders.

Initially, we wanted to identify a user experience flow for the brand personality feature inside the Typogram app: how can we make the brand personality a valuable feature to the users? What specific interactions can we include at this step, and what do they look like? </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With many hypotheses, we focused on shipping quickly for testing. We created this workshop using three popular No-Code tools easily accessible to our potential users: PDF, Google Slides, and Notion. Now that we have sped up the product development process using No-Code, we can focus on testing and making the UX as rewarding as possible. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The end product featured a main flow: users sort through different cards of brand personality and each time, they sort and choose using various methods: First, they identify based on a list of words and then narrow down based on images. Ultimately, users land on five words as visual themes/directions for their logos. Observing from our user testing session that branding is a starting point for conversation - we designed the workshop to work for solopreneurs or a team. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We organized user testing sessions and received great feedback. The success of user testing validated the flow and design of our brand personality feature inside Typogram! Because of the overwhelmingly positive response, we now make this kit a free resource for our community. </span></p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Access our Brand Personality Workshop Kit</span></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You can download our free </span><a href=\"https://workshop.typogram.co/\" title=\"Typogram's Brand Personality Workshop Kit\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Brand Personality Workshop Kit</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> on our website.

Because Typogram offers a one-brand lifetime license, you are locked down to a brand name once you purchase a paid license. However, we understand that sometimes, accidents happen. There can be spelling errors or incorrect name entries.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The old process for the brand name change was manually sending us an email or via the chat widget. Starting today, we have a better, more streamlined process: you can initiate a name change directly in the app through your project dashboard. Under the appropriate project, click “Request Change Brand Name,” to enter a new name for approval. It’ll usually approve within 24 hours.</span></p>\n<figure class=\"post__image\" ><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://typogram.co/blog/media/posts/49/brandNameChangeEditUpdate_2-2.gif\" alt=\"img: request to change brand name\" width=\"1440\" height=\"900\">\n<figcaption ><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">img: Request to change brand name</span></figcaption>\n</figure>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Upcoming: Modularized App Components &amp; Expanding Brand Personality Workshop</span></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We are currently reworking our app from the ground up with a brand-new direction to product thinking: </span><strong>modular steps and shareable work-in-progress.</strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> We take pride in our unique eight-step process for creating a professional brand, but its implementation in the app seems rigid regarding workflow adherence. You must go through a series of steps to reach the final destination—Brand Guidelines—which is the only place and time where you can share your work.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The new Typogram maintains the same brand design philosophies and workflows but is much more modular and flexible. We broke ground on this new app direction with Typogram’s first step—Brand Personality. Once completed, it will function as a modular component that can either stand alone as a mini app or serve as a segue to the full Typogram experience. The Brand Personality app will also feature a more visually stunning presentation you can save and publish. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Our plans for the future: every single step is a standalone app, much more robust, but at the same time, it is still part of the full Typogram experience. The brand design journey can start anywhere and in any order. The work product of each step is presented in a much more visually-impressive way, and you can save and share with your team or community to get feedback.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Let us know what you think of this future direction!</span></p>\n<h1> </h1>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Hearing from You</span></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We’d love to hear more of your thoughts if you have already tried the software.
