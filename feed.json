You can create a unique guidelines page for your brand and generate a printer-friendly pdf copy to either print it out for yourself as a reminder of the key assets of your brand or share the PDF with a designer you are working with. You can find the Print PDF option on the left sidebar and top right navigation on your published brand guidelines page.</span></p>\n<figure class=\"post__image\" ><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://typogram.co/blog/media/posts/46/Print-Guidelines-as-PDF_lrg.gif\" alt=\"brand guidelines pdf\" width=\"1440\" height=\"900\">\n<figcaption ><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">brand guidelines pdf</span></figcaption>\n</figure>\n<h1><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Multi-Select Design Elements </span></h1>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sometimes, you may want to implement the same design action on multiple parts of a logo – for example, making a group of letters into a smaller font size or different font. Being able to select multiple objects makes this action easier.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Now inside the logo editor, in addition to single-select, you can select multiple element by using the SHIFT key.

Click on the right or left arrow to go back and forth between steps.

One such quirk is the potential to fall through the cracks and not get featured on the front page.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What products get featured on the front page and why? From Product Hunt’s response to our complaint, it seems that manual curation plays a substantial role in their selection process:</span></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I very much regret the experience. We try our best to feature everything that is eligible and that we think will be a value add to our community. Every now and then, unfortunately, we do miss a great launch. — Product Hunt Support</span></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I think that the Product Hunt team must employ a combination of strategies to manage this workload efficiently. It seems implausible for a manual process alone to handle such a volume, making me question how they strike the right balance between human curation and algorithmic assistance.

On the launch day of Typogram, for the first four hours, Hunted Space couldn’t find Typogram and therefore didn’t crawl any stats, reporting a flat line for 0 votes until it jumped to 40 votes suddenly:</span></p>\n<figure class=\"post__image\" ><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://typogram.co/blog/media/posts/44/eb51025a-c194-48ab-8e37-b15761b9e762_980x385.jpg\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" srcset=\"https://typogram.co/blog/media/posts/44/responsive/eb51025a-c194-48ab-8e37-b15761b9e762_980x385-xs.jpg 300w ,https://typogram.co/blog/media/posts/44/responsive/eb51025a-c194-48ab-8e37-b15761b9e762_980x385-sm.jpg 480w ,https://typogram.co/blog/media/posts/44/responsive/eb51025a-c194-48ab-8e37-b15761b9e762_980x385-md.jpg 768w ,https://typogram.co/blog/media/posts/44/responsive/eb51025a-c194-48ab-8e37-b15761b9e762_980x385-lg.jpg 1024w\"  alt=\"Comparing Typogram to the product that secured the 2nd position.

It also has a flat line in the beginning section.</span></figcaption>\n</figure>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The flat line in the beginning doesn’t mean the product didn’t get votes during those times. It just means that they got no exposure that the stats crawler didn’t crawl. </span></i></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">During this time, Typogram is live on Product Hunt, but people only find it through the link we shared. In other words, we are sending traffic to Product Hunt, not the other way around. The moment we get unburied at hour 4, we already got 40 votes, purely from our own people! That is a miracle in itself! </span></p>\n<h2>How Launching on Product Hunt Works</h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We ask our community to visit Product Hunt and upvote our product, which in turn boosts our ranking. As our position improves, we attract more traffic from Product Hunt’s user base. Ideally, a successful launch results in significantly more traffic flowing from Product Hunt to our product than what we initially directed toward them. Unfortunately, it may not be the case for our launch this time.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When we finally got unburied, we had 40 votes and ranked #13. Ranking in #13 means we only get the exposure and traffic that belongs to #13, which is less than #12, which is less than #11 … you get my point. Assuming all products are equally interesting and have the same upvote ratio (the number of votes divided by the number of visitors), our vote gap is only getting larger and larger by default.</span></p>\n<p><strong>In order to climb up, we need to:</strong></p>\n<ol>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><strong>be more interesting so that the upvote ratio is higher</strong></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><strong>lead more outside traffic to your Product Hunt post</strong></li>\n</ol>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The #1 is done prior; nothing we can change on the launch day. I think our product is very unique and interesting. We trend up really quickly after we get onto the front page, thanks to that.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The #2 is counter-intuitive. We launch on Product Hunt to get more people to visit us, not the other way around. But in order to get more exposure, we have to send more traffic first. We continue to ask our community to show up and support us, and you all did. We climbed all the way from #13 to #5 in the early afternoon!</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Each position on Product Hunt corresponds to a certain level of traffic. To optimize your launch, it’s crucial to secure a top position as early as possible.</span></p>\n<p><strong>The traffic generated during a launch is determined by two factors:</strong></p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong> Your position on Product Hunt</strong></li>\n<li><strong> The duration you maintain that position</strong></li>\n</ol>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Even if some product manages to climb from the bottom to the top #1 spot at the last minute and earn the “Product of the Day” title, it won’t make a significant impact, as it would only benefit from one minute of the top position’s traffic. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We enjoyed about half a day of position #5’s traffic, and the other half day we get very little traffic.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The launch experience serves as a reminder of the importance of building our own audience. While leveraging platforms like Product Hunt can be beneficial, their outcomes are not always reliable. I was confident that our launch would secure the top #1 or #2 spot, especially since I had previously achieved #2 with a hobby project, Symbols to Copy. In comparison, Typogram is a much more interesting and robust product. Nonetheless, this experience underscores the need to focus on cultivating a community of user base independently.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Our community carried us through the launch. Without their support, we could have easily been buried throughout the entire day. Instead, we managed to emerge as #13 and continued to climb the ranks, demonstrating the power of an engaged community in driving a product’s growth.</span></p>\n<h2>Launch Stats</h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On launch day, we coincidentally acquired exactly 100 new users, and with additional sign-ups in the following week, we reached a total of 230 new users. Among these, 9 converted to paid users, resulting in a conversion rate of approximately 4%.</span></p>\n<figure class=\"post__image--wide\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://typogram.co/blog/media/posts/44/51c6586b-c80c-4083-89b8-c74fc800a3c2_720x402.png\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" srcset=\"https://typogram.co/blog/media/posts/44/responsive/51c6586b-c80c-4083-89b8-c74fc800a3c2_720x402-xs.png 300w ,https://typogram.co/blog/media/posts/44/responsive/51c6586b-c80c-4083-89b8-c74fc800a3c2_720x402-sm.png 480w ,https://typogram.co/blog/media/posts/44/responsive/51c6586b-c80c-4083-89b8-c74fc800a3c2_720x402-md.png 768w ,https://typogram.co/blog/media/posts/44/responsive/51c6586b-c80c-4083-89b8-c74fc800a3c2_720x402-lg.png 1024w\"  alt=\"\" width=\"720\" height=\"402\"></figure>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Despite feeling as though we were deprived of the #1 position, it's important to remember that a launch is not a sprint but a marathon. In the grand scheme of things, a year from now, this minor setback won't even matter the slightest. If someone is meant to become our user, we will undoubtedly cross paths with them eventually — we just have to keep going to meet them. </span></p>",

Once the brand project is created, users can’t edit the brand name independently and must contact us. A few users requested a brand name change to explore capitalizing certain letters in their logo. This limitation is not what I intended — locking the brand name shouldn’t prevent users from switching the letter case. So I immediately started designing and implementing this feature. This feature is available in this app right now!</p>\n<figure class=\"post__image\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/ZA71yxgxQ59XQ0jcCugCd0o2dzQWICX7-ViWm7O0XBN3uNOxeo0T7BYSDDDBrcyeb3UrSJn_1AHtQs9-uJV2sc5WKd3FKJx4IS10PTaioTDR5_jK6qkMfMgUa8E44L3d-o2pVDxzkZXlcuIWu2EqLWk\" data-is-external-image=\"true\"  alt=\"caseSwitch\"><figcaption>Switch letter case</figcaption></figure>\n<h1> </h1>\n<h1 id=\"new-feature-2-tool-tips\">New Feature No.2: Tool Tips</h1>\n<p>Another feedback I received was about progression. Users often have to perform specific actions inside our app before the “Continue” button appears, allowing them to progress to the next step. It is not uncommon for users to get confused about how to move forward before the “Continue” button appears for the first time. To help solve this issue, I added a disabled state of the Continue button and tooltips.</p>\n<figure class=\"post__image\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/z8Rk7d_LfO_xMkju3NRafayPJEdRqzOS6yDbskSpfD0AGbhEQRcphzgqYXKrkh1tLz7mdF3XbpWRk6Nu1Bjf9AZ-X_1V2bcTHg3c3XqrHrDcIqUUaRLgt_X72wtd2o8M5WnPl1B7VoQqok12XevqbPA\" data-is-external-image=\"true\"  alt=\"Tooltip\"><figcaption>Tool tip on Continue button</figcaption></figure>\n<hr>\n<h1 id=\"upcoming-new-feature-undoredo\">Upcoming New Feature: Undo/Redo</h1>\n<p>Undo and Redo are the most popular feature requests we have received since our launch, and we have been busy making them a reality.

Similarly, if you liked the reverted changes, simply click Redo to reapply the design choices.</p>\n<p>We added a cute micro interaction for your delight!

Long ascenders help make a lowercase more distinguishable as long as the other parts of the letters are legible.</span></p>\n<figure class=\"post__image\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://typogram.co/blog/media/posts/40/ascender-3.png\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" srcset=\"https://typogram.co/blog/media/posts/40/responsive/ascender-3-xs.png 300w ,https://typogram.co/blog/media/posts/40/responsive/ascender-3-sm.png 480w ,https://typogram.co/blog/media/posts/40/responsive/ascender-3-md.png 768w ,https://typogram.co/blog/media/posts/40/responsive/ascender-3-lg.png 1024w\"  alt=\"Ascender\" width=\"1200\" height=\"630\"></figure>\n<h1> </h1>\n<h1><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Baseline</span><a id=\"Baseline\"></a></h1>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The baseline is the horizon line (sometimes invisible) on which the letters sit. In most typefaces, curved letters, like “O,” “e,” and “s,” sit slightly below the baseline to create optical balance and alignment with other letters. Letters with descenders like “p” and “q” extend below the baseline.</span></p>\n<figure class=\"post__image\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://typogram.co/blog/media/posts/40/baseline-3.png\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" srcset=\"https://typogram.co/blog/media/posts/40/responsive/baseline-3-xs.png 300w ,https://typogram.co/blog/media/posts/40/responsive/baseline-3-sm.png 480w ,https://typogram.co/blog/media/posts/40/responsive/baseline-3-md.png 768w ,https://typogram.co/blog/media/posts/40/responsive/baseline-3-lg.png 1024w\"  alt=\"Baseline\" width=\"1200\" height=\"630\"></figure>\n<h1> </h1>\n<h1><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Bracket</span><a id=\"Bracket\"></a></h1>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A bracket is a curved or wedge-like area connecting a serif and a stroke. This curve area can be large or small. Typefaces with large areas of curves are said to have large bracketing. Those with small curved areas have small bracketing. Some serif typefaces have no bracketing. </span></p>\n<figure class=\"post__image\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://typogram.co/blog/media/posts/40/bracket-2.png\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" srcset=\"https://typogram.co/blog/media/posts/40/responsive/bracket-2-xs.png 300w ,https://typogram.co/blog/media/posts/40/responsive/bracket-2-sm.png 480w ,https://typogram.co/blog/media/posts/40/responsive/bracket-2-md.png 768w ,https://typogram.co/blog/media/posts/40/responsive/bracket-2-lg.png 1024w\"  alt=\"Bracket\" width=\"1200\" height=\"630\"></figure>\n<h1> </h1>\n<h1><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Cap Height</span><a id=\"CapHeight\"></a></h1>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Cap Height is the height of a capital letter, measured from the baseline to flat capitals like “H.” Letters like “S” and “O,” have a slight overshoot over the cap height. This is done so that curve-topped letters like “S” or “O” look optically aligned and balanced with flat-topped letters like “H.”</span></p>\n<figure class=\"post__image\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://typogram.co/blog/media/posts/40/cap-height-3.png\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" srcset=\"https://typogram.co/blog/media/posts/40/responsive/cap-height-3-xs.png 300w ,https://typogram.co/blog/media/posts/40/responsive/cap-height-3-sm.png 480w ,https://typogram.co/blog/media/posts/40/responsive/cap-height-3-md.png 768w ,https://typogram.co/blog/media/posts/40/responsive/cap-height-3-lg.png 1024w\"  alt=\"Cap Height\" width=\"1200\" height=\"630\"></figure>\n<h1> </h1>\n<h1><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Counter</span><a id=\"Counter\"></a></h1>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A counter is an unfilled (white or negative) space partially or entirely closed by other parts of the letters. For example, lowercase “b” and uppercase “U” both have counters. The stroke creating a counter shape is known as a “bowl.” There are two types of counter spaces: open and closed. An <strong>open counter</strong> means the unfilled space is partially closed, like “U.” A <strong>closed counter</strong> happens when the unfilled space is completely sealed, like “b.” </span></p>\n<figure class=\"post__image\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://typogram.co/blog/media/posts/40/counter.png\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" srcset=\"https://typogram.co/blog/media/posts/40/responsive/counter-xs.png 300w ,https://typogram.co/blog/media/posts/40/responsive/counter-sm.png 480w ,https://typogram.co/blog/media/posts/40/responsive/counter-md.png 768w ,https://typogram.co/blog/media/posts/40/responsive/counter-lg.png 1024w\"  alt=\"Counter\" width=\"1200\" height=\"630\"></figure>\n<h1> </h1>\n<h1><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Descender</span><a id=\"Descender\"></a></h1>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A descender is a vertical stroke of a lowercase letter extending below the baseline. For example, “p” is a lowercase letter with a descender. Like ascenders, long descenders make lowercase letters more distinguishable, improving readability.  </span></p>\n<figure class=\"post__image\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://typogram.co/blog/media/posts/40/descender-2.png\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" srcset=\"https://typogram.co/blog/media/posts/40/responsive/descender-2-xs.png 300w ,https://typogram.co/blog/media/posts/40/responsive/descender-2-sm.png 480w ,https://typogram.co/blog/media/posts/40/responsive/descender-2-md.png 768w ,https://typogram.co/blog/media/posts/40/responsive/descender-2-lg.png 1024w\"  alt=\"Descender\" width=\"1200\" height=\"630\"></figure>\n<h1> </h1>\n<h1><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Terminal</span><a id=\"Terminal\"></a></h1>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A Terminal is an end of a straight or curved stroke without serifs. The terminal can be a place where a typeface showcases its stylistic elements. For example, in some letters, like “a,” there can be a droplet shape at the end of a stroke. This is called a ball terminal. </span></p>\n<figure class=\"post__image\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://typogram.co/blog/media/posts/40/ball-terminal.png\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" srcset=\"https://typogram.co/blog/media/posts/40/responsive/ball-terminal-xs.png 300w ,https://typogram.co/blog/media/posts/40/responsive/ball-terminal-sm.png 480w ,https://typogram.co/blog/media/posts/40/responsive/ball-terminal-md.png 768w ,https://typogram.co/blog/media/posts/40/responsive/ball-terminal-lg.png 1024w\"  alt=\"Terminal\" width=\"1200\" height=\"630\"></figure>\n<h1> </h1>\n<h1><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">x-Height</span><a id=\"x-Height\"></a></h1>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The term x-height describes the distance from the baseline to the top of a flat-topped lowercase letter, like the lowercase “x.” x-height is a stylistic choice and varies for different typefaces. However, x-height also is a factor in readability. As the x-height increase, the length of ascenders and descenders usually decreases. This causes the letters to become less readable.</span></p>\n<figure class=\"post__image\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://typogram.co/blog/media/posts/40/x-height-2.png\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" srcset=\"https://typogram.co/blog/media/posts/40/responsive/x-height-2-xs.png 300w ,https://typogram.co/blog/media/posts/40/responsive/x-height-2-sm.png 480w ,https://typogram.co/blog/media/posts/40/responsive/x-height-2-md.png 768w ,https://typogram.co/blog/media/posts/40/responsive/x-height-2-lg.png 1024w\"  alt=\"x-Height\" width=\"1200\" height=\"630\"></figure>\n<figure class=\"post__image\" ><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://typogram.co/blog/media/posts/40/typedetails.png\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" srcset=\"https://typogram.co/blog/media/posts/40/responsive/typedetails-xs.png 300w ,https://typogram.co/blog/media/posts/40/responsive/typedetails-sm.png 480w ,https://typogram.co/blog/media/posts/40/responsive/typedetails-md.png 768w ,https://typogram.co/blog/media/posts/40/responsive/typedetails-lg.png 1024w\"  alt=\"type details\" width=\"1680\" height=\"630\">\n<figcaption >Infographic summing up type detail terms</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>Want more Typography Jargon Buster?</strong> Check out <a href=\"https://typogram.co/blog/essential-terms-you-must-know-about-typography/\"><em>Essential Typography Terms</em></a>, <em><a href=\"https://typogram.co/blog/common-styles-of-serif-fonts-you-must-know-to-improve-your-design/\">Serif</a></em>, and <em><a href=\"https://typogram.co/blog/different-types-of-sans-serifs/\">Sans Serifs Classifications You Must Know.</a></em></span></p>",

Here are the features we have been working for October. (Missed the previous updates? See <a href=\"https://typogram.co/blog/typogram-product-update-no4/\">September</a> and our archive <a href=\"https://typogram.co/blog/tags/inside-typogram/\">here</a>)</p>\n<hr>\n<h1 id=\"choosing-brand-colors\">Choosing Brand Colors</h1>\n<p>This month, we focused on a critical feature: Brand Colors. From chatting with our customers, we know many struggles with brand colors, so we focused on making this feature as visual and accessible as possible.</p>\n<p>There are several things we have created in this feature to help you choose colors:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Preview Primary Brand Color in Graphics</li>\n<li>Grayscale Colors</li>\n<li>Accent Colors</li>\n<li>View Color Tips</li>\n<li>Hex Input and More</li>\n</ul>\n<hr>\n<h2 id=\"detail-1-preview-primary-brand-color-in-graphics\">Detail 1: Preview Primary Brand Color in Graphics</h2>\n<p>A common misconception is that color value is absolute and can stand on its own. While it is true mathematically, it is false optically. Our eyes absolutely do fool us at times — a red color can look 100% blue once put next to a set of certain colors and shades. It is essential to build a color palette for your brand instead of a singular color. With Typogram, you can preview the primary brand color palettes in a graphic in real time as you are making changes.</p>\n<p><figure class=\"post__image\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/vEFH-HQhistnsmasPrhvAHCiwnUK2FcAfZKg7L5A3IDz6DfsO8pmU5K89XdK0DLTcmLD6_OzP1pl66PoJG1QDWNFJPmRkGhV7FK1OGDCPZBz7xDgtQvfuQQOSO3BYHju2B_1KKqeBGfNn4cunbTMGAy2B8He1Ui_c4rUJCKP5XWC2JWn1I3fU7-JMg\" data-is-external-image=\"true\"  alt=\"Preview Primary Brand Color in Graphics\" /></figure></p>\n<figcaption align = \"center\"> Preview Primary Brand Color in Graphics</figcaption>\n\n\n\n<hr>\n<h2 id=\"detail-2-grayscale-colors\">Detail 2: Grayscale Colors</h2>\n<p>A common pitfall of branding is over-using brand color everywhere. A booklet full of bright blue text is not a good idea — when used excessively, the brand color disappears instead of standing out. Brand colors are meant to be used somewhat scarcely and stand out amid more neutral tones — that is where the grayscale color palette comes in. Grayscale colors have very low saturation, which you can adjust between 0% to 16%. It is also a good idea to make the “neutral” gray not entirely neutral. Inject the hue of the primary brand color into the grayscale colors to hint at your brand color subtly. Even when your logo is not present, users can still feel your brand’s presence because the dark gray text radiates your brand color in small doses. </p>\n<p><figure class=\"post__image\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/BDPFzagU7D6wc6y4jEylltPFqKYglkXhRzmDkj5iF9D-_7LUeOwoG771ukxSn8PDDJLauIXDFk_qKj0aACdfbiqn255PLgS9U-v5wCMGUkS_nY43k2EENpK4NrqHrBEsa0MJI5TEDxBdBh5i7DqdBL8fC1xrG2VbSsQJe_Mt7SeDPX05h1MHXYnzHA\" data-is-external-image=\"true\"  alt=\"gif: Grayscale Colors\" /></figure></p>\n<figcaption align = \"center\">Grayscale Colors</figcaption>\n\n<hr>\n<h2 id=\"detail-3-accent-colors\">Detail 3: Accent Colors</h2>\n<p>Unlike grayscale colors, which are a must-have, accent colors are optional and up to you to decide. Similar to grayscale colors’ “binding” to the primary brand color in hue values, accent colors bind with the primary color in saturation values to create harmony.</p>\n<p><figure class=\"post__image\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/E96ovZ-sXL0hNS8ju4dgFXt0_vwS-9mVGMkvmN_sjt1F11lNDdsF_swmP-s8dSRIkQUtsEK5SQFrIWcE7OhW89s_mrw0ZGO_tIzH6Ju9oACKWjfysIcVrBeASfBcvnBSt_DFu00lGJnZjXVAognOZZdq_dapHBfEdrtWm7Mmajgc8UhAKFsG8iKY6Q\" data-is-external-image=\"true\"  alt=\"Accent Colors\" /></figure></p>\n<figcaption align = \"center\">Accent Colors</figcaption>\n\n<hr>\n<h2 id=\"detail-4-view-color-tips\">Detail 4: View Color Tips</h2>\n<p>Choosing brand colors is not an instinct thing. Instinct will draw me to colors that appeal to me personally, but my favorite color will not be the most suitable for my company and its audience. We should ditch our instinct for a little bit and choose values in hue, saturation, and lightness, respectively, based on rationales. “View Tips” provide rationales to you in real-time while you drag the values up and down. What does hue 19 mean in brand color psychology? The tips section gives a direct, timely answer to help you decide.</p>\n<p><figure class=\"post__image\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/ZVbRB_C14nkZUz4jWTWY5_q7tuktr6jbWqNYc-wIqbv8WnEOAuoO3KD2mtUcc-GDO36kXMIUEgHF5HVXomjj3_pDQdvCcyHiLxyego8tdH-6vEvqR0YGft9ivVglXEDfxdNz0gW_yFv1nqt08qLStVJSN2Yd_20zH_vfi0x4tSM8OuXArHkoslwJzQ\" data-is-external-image=\"true\"  alt=\"View Color Tips\" /></figure></p>\n<figcaption align = \"center\">View Color Tips</figcaption>\n\n<hr>\n<h2 id=\"detail-5-hex-input-and-more\">Detail 5: Hex Input and More</h2>\n<p>While HSL (hue, saturation, and lightness) is Typogram’s chosen way to define a color, you may already have a color that you want to bring in. Simply input the hex value with or without “#” or the color names and hit enter; if it is a valid color code or name, Typogram will recognize it and set HSL values accordingly. If it is not a valid color, the app will revert to the last valid color you selected.</p>\n<p><figure class=\"post__image\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/CgcPBQl3FkEvVdSMw1gKEgHP1jObxdKTjbw4Ir4KwASnap2it1-MVAxdHHAZBc4At1Ve3AZRu6WF43AqPrSHGc9AiaKJT3k8j9aRh9AYF6RxzIvLg220sZe9PXXah2xHfpA-au0E7OBu-8a9ba3Htfa9yR39YmNGIGvCs7AE0d5RHf095jvQAeIOJg\" data-is-external-image=\"true\"  alt=\"Hex Input and More\" /></figure></p>\n<figcaption align = \"center\">Hex Input and More</figcaption>\n\n<hr>\n<h1 id=\"save--access-brand-color-swatches\">Save &amp; Access Brand Color Swatches</h1>\n<p>Once the brand colors are chosen, they are saved and can be accessed via the color swatch panel.
