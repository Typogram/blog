            "content_html": "<p><em>If you are looking for weekly dose of design tips and inspirations, check out our <a href=\"https://fontdiscovery.typogram.co/\">FontDiscovery newsletter</a>!</em></p>\n<hr>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Hi, I am trying to design branding and marketing for my small business. \nHow do I get started?  I don’t have any ideas.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h2 id=\"initialize-your-ideas-and-turn-them-into-visuals\">Initialize your ideas and turn them into visuals</h2>\n<p>You have ideas. You just don’t know the best way to visualize it. Most of the time, when I visualize ideas, I start by writing things down.</p>\n<p>If it is my brand, the first thing I write down a mission or vision statement, then I write down a list of adjectives associated with this statement.</p>\n<p>For example, at Typogram, our statement is “empower everyone with design and creativity.”</p>\n<p><strong>First, I will write a couple of values that I want my brand to project to my customers visually.</strong></p>\n<p><em>Empowering, Creative, Fun</em></p>\n<p><strong>Then, I can go on Pinterest or any image discovery platform and start pulling together some images to create mood boards.</strong> Lots of people tend to skip this step, but it is super important. Building a mood board helps you build a style/ aesthetic library in your computer and mentally. I know it sounds a little magical, but it’s true. By making a mood board, you will better imagine what your brand can become, visually.</p>\n<hr>\n<h2 id=\"discover-and-expand-your-visuals\">Discover and expand your visuals</h2>\n<p>How do we build a mood board from each word? </p>\n<p>Consider each word from different angles (customer side, the business side, and so on).</p>\n<p><strong>Take the word <em>empowering</em>,  for example:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>What are some emotions associated with empowering?  Maybe Serious? Happiness? Warmth?</li>\n<li>What are actions associated with empowering?  Maybe Protest? Diversity? Inclusion? Support Groups?</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Search on these terms on Pinterest and see what kind of images will come up.</p>\n<p><strong>You might see:</strong></p>\n<p><em>Serious</em> → dark colors?</p>\n<p><em>Happiness</em> → pictures of smiling people,</p>\n<p><em>Warmth</em> → sunshine? Yellow, orange, warm colors?</p>\n<p><em>Protest</em> → protest poster art, bold fonts</p>\n<p>It could be images of people displaying emotions, landscapes, a specific texture, a particular color, a particular event that resonates with you. Choose the images you like and try to pin down the reason you choose a specific image.</p>\n<p>You can do this for a few terms. It’s good to have a collection of images (more than 20) for each board. That way, you can identify a running theme among images of within a board, like colors, styles, or aesthetics. This will give you some directions on color palettes, or look and feel of your brand.</p>\n<hr>\n<h2 id=\"collect-inspirations-and-turn-them-into-value\">Collect inspirations and turn them into value</h2>\n<p>Mood boards are an excellent resource for inspiration. In addition, it can serve as a collection of resources for your other visual content, such as blog posts, newsletter graphics, or social media posts. It is also a great reference document to hand off to a freelancer or an agency if you are working with one. When I worked at an agency, we feel relieved when clients give us mood boards because it shows us what they are thinking.</p>\n<p>Of course, this is my process. You can always do something different that works for you!</p>\n",

            "content_html": "<p><em>If you are looking for weekly dose of design tips and inspirations, check out our <a href=\"https://fontdiscovery.typogram.co/\">FontDiscovery newsletter</a>!</em></p>\n<hr>\n<p>When you design your brand, it may be helpful to know some key concepts. Here is a list of relevant terms and ideas for branding and design that could be helpful as you work through your design and marketing projects.</p>\n<h2 id=\"brand-identity\">Brand Identity</h2>\n<p>Brand identity is the visual aspect of a brand. Brand identity includes your logo, imagery, typography, colors, and creative assets. Together, these elements make your brand recognizable to your customers. Your brand identity is one of the most important parts when it comes to creating your brand.</p>\n<p><figure class=\"post__image\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://staging.typogram.co/blog/media/posts/6/brandIdentity.gif\" alt=\"Brand Identity\" width=\"1600\" height=\"796\" /></figure></p>\n<h2 id=\"logo\">Logo</h2>\n<p>The logo is the piece of artwork that represents your brand. While a logo is only a single piece of artwork, it is used everywhere on your brand, like landing pages, social media for marketing, and ads. That’s why when you create your logo, you should think about its usability in different environments. There are times when you may have to display your logo in a small size. There might be times when your logo will end up in a dark background. Keeping those restrictions in mind at the beginning will save you troubles later on.</p>\n<p><figure class=\"post__image\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://staging.typogram.co/blog/media/posts/6/logo.gif\" alt=\"Logo\" width=\"1600\" height=\"796\" /></figure></p>\n<h2 id=\"brand-color\">Brand Color</h2>\n<p>Brand color is the primary color associated with your brand. It can be on logos, business cards, decks, social media posts, websites, and other branding materials.</p>\n<p>It’s also the color your audience will associate your brand with. For example, Home Depot’s brand color is orange.</p>\n<p><figure class=\"post__image\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://staging.typogram.co/blog/media/posts/6/brandColor.gif\" alt=\"Brand Color\" width=\"1600\" height=\"796\" /></figure></p>\n<h2 id=\"white-spacenegative-space\">White Space/Negative Space</h2>\n<p>White space, also called negative space, is the area that is left empty in design. It could be around the content or artwork(like a photo),  inside the content, or in-between two pieces of content. White space is crucial because it gives the elements in your design breathing room and provides ease for the viewer when they look at the information. Good use of white space also guides the audience’s eyes from one piece of content to the next, creating a hierarchy of information.</p>\n<h2 id=\"positive-space\">Positive Space</h2>\n<p>Positive space is the counterpart of negative space. The positive space is the space that the subject (this can be the content, or artwork) takes up.</p>\n<p><figure class=\"post__image\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://staging.typogram.co/blog/media/posts/6/twitterNegativePositve.gif\" alt=\"Positive Space\" width=\"2222\" height=\"1108\" /></figure></p>\n<h2 id=\"design-composition\">Design Composition</h2>\n<p>Design composition is how design elements are placed on a page. Since elements are positive space and the unused space is negative space, we can also say that composition is the overall distribution of positive and negative spaces in the design.</p>\n<p>A general rule for creating good composition is to find balance between negative and positive space. When there is a lack of balance between negative and positive, there is tension. However, tension can also be explored to create powerful compositions. </p>\n<h2 id=\"design-grid\">Design Grid</h2>\n<p>Grids in design are systems for creating and organizing layouts. The layouts can be for print or screen. In design, “form follows function,” and layout is the perfect example of this. Different grids(layouts) suit different purposes.</p>\n<p><figure class=\"post__image\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://staging.typogram.co/blog/media/posts/6/twitterDesignGrids.gif\" alt=\"Design Grid\" width=\"2222\" height=\"1108\" /></figure></p>\n<p>img: Different grids have different uses. </p>\n<h2 id=\"typography-system\">Typography System</h2>\n<p>Typography System is the combination of fonts and font styles that create your visual branding system. For example, you typically have corresponding fonts and font styles for headers, subheads, and body copy on the landing page. For branding, we will normally use the same typography system across most of the branding assets to create a consistent message.</p>\n<h2 id=\"typographic-hierarchy\">Typographic Hierarchy</h2>\n<p>Typographic hierarchy is the visual cue of scale and spatial relationship between the specific font styles. Typography hierarchy is crucial. It shows the audience which information is the most important and which is the least. For example, on your landing page, you probably want to capture the customers’ attention by first guiding them to the product’s unique value, then offer them a detailed description.</p>\n<p>To achieve this visually, you can make the header containing the copy for values of the product to be bigger and bolder in style than the detailed description of the product. That way, the eyes traveled to the header first, then to the description of the project.</p>\n<p><figure class=\"post__image\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://staging.typogram.co/blog/media/posts/6/typographySystem.png\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" srcset=\"https://staging.typogram.co/blog/media/posts/6/responsive/typographySystem-xs.png 300w ,https://staging.typogram.co/blog/media/posts/6/responsive/typographySystem-sm.png 480w ,https://staging.typogram.co/blog/media/posts/6/responsive/typographySystem-md.png 768w ,https://staging.typogram.co/blog/media/posts/6/responsive/typographySystem-lg.png 1024w\"  alt=\"Typography System\" width=\"2024\" height=\"1012\" /></figure></p>\n<p><figure class=\"post__image\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://staging.typogram.co/blog/media/posts/6/typographyHierachy.png\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" srcset=\"https://staging.typogram.co/blog/media/posts/6/responsive/typographyHierachy-xs.png 300w ,https://staging.typogram.co/blog/media/posts/6/responsive/typographyHierachy-sm.png 480w ,https://staging.typogram.co/blog/media/posts/6/responsive/typographyHierachy-md.png 768w ,https://staging.typogram.co/blog/media/posts/6/responsive/typographyHierachy-lg.png 1024w\"  alt=\"Typography Hierachy\" width=\"2024\" height=\"1012\" /></figure></p>\n<p>img: Information hierarchy is establish through scale relationship using fonts and font pairing.</p>\n<p><strong>Hopefully these can help you as you work on design projects for your startup!</strong> </p>\n<hr>\n<p>Do you have any additional questions or suggestions?  Let me know via Twitter <a href=\"https://twitter.com/typogramco\">@typogramco</a></p>\n",

Throughout history, it has been used to depict emotions, delight audiences, and change how we see the world. Artist Pablo Picasso used different colors intentionally and exclusively to express feelings. Painter Paul Cezanne led the Post-Impressionist art movement by reinventing how color is used in landscape paintings.</p>\n<p><figure class=\"post__image\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/Fzj9dg_qsjSq9StT_ar5uEuROdk007kgidxAa_uwzwT0pqhtmXjuQCwkJnsmWKf5H3qryhnX-UjnSvKCwD8aGNyGbdkV1YSPJHGesVuMDbZzS-h5JEAAeMSZyEmZgFbeUevH8CgY=s0\" data-is-external-image=\"true\"  alt=\"paulCezzaneColorUse\" /></figure></p>\n<p>img: Paul Cezanne’s impressionist landscape paintings had a revolutionary way of using color.

Whether it’s landing pages, products, branding, social posts, choosing and using colors effectively can help your audience recognize and remember your brand.</p>\n<hr>\n<h1 id=\"primary-branding-color\">Primary Branding Color</h1>\n<h2 id=\"what-is-a-primary-color\">What is a primary color?</h2>\n<p>Primary color is the main color that is used on marketing graphics, website, signage. Typically, this is the main color that is associated with your brand. For example, the primary brand color for Coca cola is red.</p>\n<p><figure class=\"post__image\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/pXDOlFKHsgDpJgBZorhNIy3wLXjtP2GsGSFLFpJag_ZOoIdR1IGSfdgSIo-JLxZWXwdCnj4dpncAbG6LQ7Jlxu4hM_Dk8vpNrwLhoOzSR0ygcvshWaUL43AKiZkQfvxShWKRe2Ud=s0\" data-is-external-image=\"true\"  alt=\"cocaColaBrand\" /></figure></p>\n<p>img: you will find this classic red in alot of coca cola’s branding.

There are a couple of approaches you can take:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Look at what similar brands in your niche are doing.</li>\n<li>Research about what values colors are associated with.</li>\n<li>Create mood boards of things or values inspired or associated with your brand. I wrote more about this process <a href=\"https://blog.typogram.co/How-to-Visualize-Ideas-for-Your-Brand-ffad9dc7d0704bfb8e45f23db4c420a9\">here.</a> You can then sample colors from images in your mood boards.</li>\n</ol>\n<p><figure class=\"post__image\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/DrfmgNzxb2FOPF4AoSqvGyZgOJQjYPjTeqr_UYomKDk_rq2ukmx9niDihwtJsNjwDrkINbB6FnFgn9ix8c3LMQwUu3gwxHdy8dFQBMU5iT49F6xyTeCHq8YBC1-NkUNpbjJJXj_t=s0\" data-is-external-image=\"true\"  alt=\"colorthemeInspirationChart\" /></figure></p>\n<p>img: a simple chart I made of colors with their common associations.</p>\n<p>Once you find a color that resonates, it is essential to test it in the environments you will be using. You also want to test how this specific color performs on black and white backgrounds. This test tells you if the color you are using is too vibrant or too dark. You want to make sure it is legible and visible. If you are using it in product packaging, test it out printed. Checking colors is simple, and it saves you time down the line.</p>\n<hr>\n<h1 id=\"secondary-color\">Secondary Color</h1>\n<p>Some brands have a few colors they use consistently along with the primary brand color. These colors are called secondary colors. A secondary color is not a requirement for branding. However, it is nice to have to highlight or complement a primary color. It provides more ways to add recognition and distinguishment to your brands. While there isn’t a rule on how many secondary colors you can have, you should try to limit yourself to about three or four so the brand remains recognizable, and the message remains clear. Having too many colors can be distracting and confusing. You should always use one color as the primary.</p>\n<p><figure class=\"post__image\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/jtbBYGaiGSjHfFFAS_F0XmEUyKhuhZw-B9zRMQkaVvy5wYLDKuyTSf2_1CtnayMnSKWQCa66L2Tp1Kba-ezKBasEWgGd1bnuaNk3Hm2RrM4n5dGqyzI3GX-dduKMDHIffdi37aUa=s0\" data-is-external-image=\"true\"  alt=\"iKeaColorPalette\" /></figure></p>\n<p>img: Ikea’s color palettes using blue as the primary color, yellow as as secondary color; source: dazeen</p>\n<p><figure class=\"post__image\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/Djzv2gbDHu8dlVoLWbuyaBM7XqhLx39_X21Nj5EKZr4HcHWjcx1Y43HLu8YFC5YcxBmvAr0-5MHRavBikazN19q39HW9gS7_k5YlQv4wr8R4gHmGTnHsKGF2ekgmM6gQN8IJQrxB=s0\" data-is-external-image=\"true\"  alt=\"mcDonaldColorPalette\" /></figure></p>\n<p>img: McDonald’s color palettes using red as the primary color, yellow as as secondary color; source: <a href=\"https://adage.com/creativity/work/mcdonalds-new-visual-identity/2184596\">AdAge</a> </p>\n<h2 id=\"how-to-pick-a-secondary-color\">How to pick a secondary color?</h2>\n<p>There are several ways you can pick your secondary colors.</p>\n<p>As a starting point, you can think about:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Is there another color you liked when you picked the primary color?</li>\n<li>Is there a color that pairs well with the primary color?</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"color-pairing\">Color Pairing</h2>\n<p>Combining color can be tricky.
