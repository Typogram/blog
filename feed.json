            "content_html": "<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Happy New Year! Recently, we launched the latest version of Typogram on Product Hunt. Our main goals for this launch were deliver our latest product before 2023 ends and experiment with our launch strategy. We want to devise a marketing plan to maximize our product growth during this launch period. Our solution was a month-long marketing campaign, with a product hunt launch as a culminating event. Now that the launch has ended, we want to share our tips and learnings for this launch in this post. </span></p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Quick Stats for Launch Day </span></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Here are some quick stats for day of the launch:</span></p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Build in Public Newsletter subscriber + 10</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">+ 262 registered users the week of the launch</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">3 sales on the day of launch (with more sales before and after the launch during the sales window)</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">No.8 product of the day - Our peak position was No.2</span></li>\n</ul>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Helpful Strategies </span></h2>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">No.1: Marketing Idea Bank</span></h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To help us quickly come up with things to share and promote during the weeks before launch, we create an idea bank for content. For each week, we identified a theme/ idea we wanted to share around our launch. We then searched our content library of relevant posts and visuals and developed them into tweets. This aimed to grow our newsletter subscribers and reach on Twitter.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">By the end, we gained the most followers on Twitter. In comparison, the newsletter grew less in subscribers. This could be because Twitter’s algorithm deprioritizes tweets with links, especially Substack links. Looking back, the idea bank is a tool I will keep implementing because it makes marketing easy. Like most introverts, I struggle with finding things to say on social media, especially regarding sales and marketing. In the future, I want to develop an idea bank for every single marketing event. </span></p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">No.2: Running a month-long sale during the launch day</span></h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We previously ran a sale on the Product Hunt platform on launch day. This time, we ran two parallel sales – one on our own and one through a Lifetime Deals Facebook group. The price for the basic tier (our single-brand lifetime license ) was the same for both sales, and we ran both sales for about a month. Our (own) campaign performed well and generated several sales weeks before and after the launch. The promo at the Facebook group was interesting and gave us several paid customers who ordered multiple licenses. I will share more about our experience and learning with the LTD Facebook group channel in a separate post. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Overall, running a sales campaign parallel to the launch was a good move. It helped us talk about our product a lot more. Next time, I want to experiment with a shorter sales window, like a two-week sale, rather than a monthly long sale, especially for the LTD group. </span></p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Highlights from Launch</span></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The launch day was a day full of ups and downs. The launch’s best part is seeing our community’s love and support, which can't be measured in numbers. Here are some top highlights.</span></p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">No.1 – Tofu is loved</span></h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Throughout the launch, Tofu was liked and tweeted many times. Her face was seeing 11.4k times around Twitter. I think she may be a nano influencer now. 😁</span></p>\n<figure ><figure class=\"post__image centerBlogPostImage\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/m3rmIoHGbBx4ek4byLaYrID8veQ0PbRbd0GsOgzZzUkrLwRv1Xq6QTyKFsmv8bso1fBIKpBicJa8bnEDGTT_3oopBYUU6SYICPBMbUJrO54s6-FNhBie99j-uFFG4Rm5IedNsRiDBAf4UegyuXu_25g\" data-is-external-image=\"true\"  alt=\"Tofu working hard\" width=\"422\" height=\"801\"></figure>\n<figcaption >Tofu working hard</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">No.2 – We got so much love on the launch day!</span></h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Our launch page on Product Hunt was flooded with love, helpful feedback, and suggestions. ❤️.</span></p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/LKqZrm_tmj_0F5R18ltaiCcNu0fs6wSM_2YZcsD0CkzQw8gF1yZ251H9_HKaYpNrxCHQCVZC7ne64ISbepqhGfuqJSIX88hGRUcM818JJYNXr4dFXqXeuAidswD3Tjho47GsD8rnPogcYtvS9tfE7VM\" data-is-external-image=\"true\" ></p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br></span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">No.3 – We have the most passionate users</span></h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Check out Frank’s video reviewing Typogram!</span></p>\n<figure class=\"post__video\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" width=\"560\" height=\"314\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/DoS19uMBhqM\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" data-mce-fragment=\"1\"></iframe></figure>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Final Words </span></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We are so thankful to our users and community for supporting us thus far.

We are also working on a special AI feature. All of these are available soon in the upcoming roll-out!</span></p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Upcoming: Multi-Lines Logo Layout</span></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ever wanted to create a stacked logo or a design splitting across multiple lines? You could accomplish this easily with our new logo layout feature. You’ll be able to add a line break to split your logo into a new line or remove line breaks to adjust your logo layout, creating layouts like a vertical or stacked design. When you get a creative idea, you want to get the ideas out of your head. We get that, so we took extra time to ensure it’s easy for you to control the details of the logo layout. You can play with line spacing and alignment and preview them easily with selected brand fonts. </span></p>\n<figure class=\"post__image\" ><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://typogram.co/blog/media/posts/56/logoLayout_3.gif\" alt=\"Multi-Lines logo layout feature \" width=\"1440\" height=\"900\">\n<figcaption ><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Multi-Lines logo layout feature </span></figcaption>\n</figure>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Upcoming: Adding Extra Lines of Text</span></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Have a short tagline below the logo? Want to add a small text like a founding date, a structure like “LLC” or a category like “music”? Soon inside the logo editor, you can add extra lines to your logo, allowing you to create infinite additional logo variations of your brand. You can then design your brand new tagline logo in the logo editor. Change your mind? No problem – you can also remove the extra text element. This is one of the most popular feature requests we’ve gotten, and we can’t wait to have you try it in the app. </span></p>\n<figure class=\"post__image\" ><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://typogram.co/blog/media/posts/56/addText_3.gif\" alt=\"Adding extra lines of text in our logo editor\" width=\"1440\" height=\"900\">\n<figcaption >Adding extra lines of text in our logo editor</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Upcoming: Magic Fairy Dust — AI-Generated Icon</span></h2>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This is something special we’ve been preparing.

Embracing AI as an enhancement, not a replacement, we took a cautious approach to adding AI to amplify creativity and innovation while staying true to our product’s original DNA and distinctly different from generated logos. We’ll share more about this exciting update soon! You can get a first look at our Product Hunt page on December 12th.</span><a href=\"https://www.producthunt.com/products/typogram\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Follow here</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> for our launch.</span></p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Upcoming: Try Typogram as a Guest</span></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We’ve been aiming to make Typogram easier to try.

We realize PH launches can be a vehicle instead of a single event. Instead of considering the PH launch as the solitary main event, we could see it as the culminating event. That way, we can grow and build hype around the product in multiple ways.</p>\n<div class=\"pullquote\">\n<p>You can <a href=\"https://www.producthunt.com/products/typogram\">follow</a> our actions here! 🚀</p>\n</div>\n<p><strong>So, we are trying a new experiment. </strong></p>\n<h3 class=\"header-with-anchor-widget\">First Three Weeks</h3>\n<p>Rather than promoting intensely for two weeks right before and concentrating solely on the launch event, we have been promoting the whole month, with the first three weeks centered on broadening our reach. We created a content bank from our previous blog posts and newsletter issues. We then crafted tweets, posts, and graphics and scheduled them on our Twitter accounts. We are focusing on: </p>\n<ul>\n<li>Grow subscribers for our build-in-public newsletter <br><br></li>\n<li>Gain free account users and increase exposure to Typogram<br><br></li>\n<li>Increase our Twitter audience before the launch to maximize reach</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 class=\"header-with-anchor-widget\">Final Week</h3>\n<p>In the final week, we’ll focus more intensely on Product Hunt, utilizing methods we learned from previous launches. </p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Gather the support of our friends from different time zones </p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Get active on product hunt community forums </p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Mystery launch photoshoot (this is something fun we are doing- can’t wait to share with you more)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Launch exclusive post with call the action to PH launch soon page </p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 class=\"header-with-anchor-widget\">How is it going?</h3>\n<p>We are in the third week, and We’ve been scheduling and posting tweets. So far, it’s working great. I've been getting more active on Twitter, and now working on Reddit. Next week, I'll start doing more behind-the-scenes work exclusively for the launch. </p>\n<p> </p>",

We’ve made countless improvements and bug fixes. A few major ones: </p>\n<h4>Improving Overall User Experience</h4>\n<p>This overhaul was not merely a switch but a journey where we painstakingly crushed reported bugs, resolved technical debt, and discovered more efficient ways to execute, all aimed at enhancing the quality of Typogram for our users. Our new app, now optimized for performance and rendering, effectively addressed and resolved many previous issues, such as font loading and rendering.</p>\n<h4>Complete Rework of Redo-Undo Feature</h4>\n<p>We completely rebuilt this feature and fixed the “ghost artboard flashback” issue. Also, by switching the data storage method, the feature can now handle a much longer edit history, allowing you to go way back in artboard history if you ever find regrets in your design journey.</p>\n<h4>Brand New Login Page</h4>\n<p>Our new modular code base has significantly enhanced our development process, enabling us to add new features more easily and quickly. </p>\n<p>Previously, we used a pre-packaged login page, which occasionally had users stuck in an infinite login loop. We didn’t have control over this external code to fix the bug. With our new custom login page, we have now resolved the issue. It is more reliable, beautiful, and has nice user experience details. </p>\n<div class=\"captioned-image-container\">\n<figure>\n<div class=\"image2-inset\"><picture><source type=\"image/webp\" srcset=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_lossy/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ffaafd2b7-63b6-41f6-a236-f779cff1e65d_1440x900.gif 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_lossy/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ffaafd2b7-63b6-41f6-a236-f779cff1e65d_1440x900.gif 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_lossy/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ffaafd2b7-63b6-41f6-a236-f779cff1e65d_1440x900.gif 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_lossy/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ffaafd2b7-63b6-41f6-a236-f779cff1e65d_1440x900.gif 1456w\" sizes=\"100vw\"></picture>\n<figure class=\"sizing-normal\" ><figure class=\"post__image\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_lossy/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ffaafd2b7-63b6-41f6-a236-f779cff1e65d_1440x900.gif\" data-is-external-image=\"true\"  sizes=\"100vw\" srcset=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_lossy/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ffaafd2b7-63b6-41f6-a236-f779cff1e65d_1440x900.gif 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_lossy/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ffaafd2b7-63b6-41f6-a236-f779cff1e65d_1440x900.gif 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_lossy/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ffaafd2b7-63b6-41f6-a236-f779cff1e65d_1440x900.gif 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_lossy/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ffaafd2b7-63b6-41f6-a236-f779cff1e65d_1440x900.gif 1456w\" alt=\"Gif: Auto-direct to Sign Up or Sign In based on your account status\" width=\"1440\" height=\"900\" data-attrs=\"{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/faafd2b7-63b6-41f6-a236-f779cff1e65d_1440x900.gif&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:900,&quot;width&quot;:1440,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:&quot;https://typogram.co/sign-in&quot;,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:false,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null}\"></figure>\n<figcaption ><em>Gif: Auto-direct to Sign Up or Sign In based on your account status</em></figcaption>\n</figure>\n</div>\n<figcaption class=\"image-caption\"></figcaption>\n</figure>\n</div>\n<h4>Better Free Plan</h4>\n<p>Another major update: We are making Typogram easier to try and recommend.

This </span><a href=\"https://typogram.co/workshop\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Brand Personality Workshop Kit</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> is structured like a workbook with instructions and actionable for participants.

Once you are used to the user interface, the editor is intuitive and allows you to create automation flows between different apps. I use Make to set up part of the payment system for Typogram.

We offered a discounted lifetime deal for a single-brand license for this pre-order. Users can edit their logo forever inside our app as long as it's for the same brand. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At this point, we have yet to complete coding for the entire tool, like account management and payment. We wanted to gauge the interest first with our current set of features. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On the landing page, we had a demo video of our features, made using Webflow, which we still use for our product (if you go to our landing page now, you can still see the video). We also collected testimonials from our user testing sessions to feature on the landing page as social proofs. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We launched this on Product Hunt and in the channels we've been developing (our newsletters) and got about 16 paid customers and 1,500 site visits in the first two weeks. Here is a </span><a href=\"https://typogram.co/blog/what-we-learned-from-launching-our-startup-on-product-hunt/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">detailed post</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> if you wish to see the stats from that launch. </span></p>\n<figure class=\"post__image\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/Q5UlwGCljMprpu1PBExVcI7tb7X5VQgE1ZuTSY2Vt1uiuzcMkEQWQO6GjMR9quexxwbqEg-wJTx9mJgN2yqKmZVKSxXHZ4AmlC_qmCrV5Fju0mMVLXUgxCNdStOtTfB29MaOqD2ZuUpi_u1XrO3nVQ4\" data-is-external-image=\"true\"  alt=\"our product hunt launch\"><figcaption>Our product hunt launch for Typogram's pre-order</figcaption></figure>\n<hr>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Short Term: Growth &amp; Traction </span></h2>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Find Your First 10 Customers and First 100 Registered Users </span></h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Build it, and they will come, right? Unfortunately, no - : ( </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">My hard lessons learned: you have to get tractions from \"do things that don't scale.\" </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For Typogram, most of these come down to posting, sharing, and creating content around our product and topics potential users are excited about, followed by (mini) product/side project launches. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Typogram was publicly launched in April 2023 and now has over 1,500 registered users. We have been successful with content marketing and Engineering as marketing for growth. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Write content your potential new users will like. You can find topics for these by either interviewing them or searching on communities like Quora or Reddit.

I highly recommend this strategy because you are not tied to the platform, and you can start creating a community and finding supporters immediately.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Typogram has two weekly newsletters: a </span><a href=\"https://build.typogram.co/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">built-in public newsletter</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> about our startup journey and </span><a href=\"https://fontdiscovery.typogram.co/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">a design newsletter</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, sharing beginner-friendly tips for typography, branding, and logo design. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In our newsletters, we share our startup journey. We also find topics to write about by researching what our users are interested in through Reddit. Initially, I was worried I couldn't maintain the consistency required for newsletters. Most days, it was easy to come up with topics to write about. Writing to an audience also helped me stay motivated. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Strategies for growing the newsletters include sharing on relevant communities, like Reddit, Indiehackers, and Twitter, and cross-promotion with other newsletters.</span></p>\n<h4><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Reddit</span></h4>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Reddit is an excellent place filled with communities of all sorts of interests. A proud Redditor since 2010s, Reddit is my preferred platform. Redditors hate spamming, and mods can permanently ban you from the site if you break the rules of their communities. In most subreddits, you will find rules on the right-hand side specifying community rules. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The most efficient way to market on Reddit is to ask for feedback about my project and focus on being helpful. Another useful technique is to filter posts by \"Hot\" and look at what topics people have written about that the followers of the subreddits already liked. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You can then use these as prompts to create your content and posts. Lastly, you can be helpful in the comments and subtly plug your products. Comments are less moderated. </span></p>\n<h4><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Power-up: F5Bot</span></h4>\n<p><a href=\"https://f5bot.com/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">F5Bot</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> is a fantastic, free resource that helps you level up your Reddit game by allowing you to track keywords on those platforms. You will get posts with targeted keywords delivered to your inbox. I primarily use this tool to understand and engage with my potential users in the startup communities.</span></p>\n<h4><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Secret Hack</span></h4>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It is possible to become a moderator of an abandoned subreddit. Many subreddits (anywhere from under 100 to over 10k in size) have inactive moderators. If you have enough karma points, you can apply to be a mod for inactive communities. Though you will have to perform extra labor of monitoring content, it could be very effective if it's in your niche.</span></p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Engineering as Marketing </span></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Engineering as Marketing can be more costly than other growth tactics in the short term, utilizing more time and effort in a concentrated block of time. However, if your engineering as marketing project takes off, you get a great new digital real estate, a nice traffic boost, and even SEO benefits. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For example, we launched </span><a href=\"https://codingfont.com/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Coding Font</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> as an Engineering as Marketing project for Typogram. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Because many potential users for Typogram are web devs and people who spent a lot of time in IDE, we wanted to create a fun little website where they could find their dream coding font. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When we launched Coding Font on Product Hunt, we got </span><a href=\"https://build.typogram.co/p/stats-of-coding-font-launch\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">​​22,000 visits on launch day</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. Coding Font was featured on the front page of Hackernews and on blogs like <a href=\"https://boingboing.net/2021/10/27/click-your-way-to-your-favorite-monospace-font.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">BoingBoing</a> and <a href=\"https://css-tricks.com/coding-font-game/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">CSS Tricks</a>, improving its backlink profile and site ranking. We seized this opportunity to add blog content and keywords to this site. As a result, we got newsletter sign-ups, sales, and continuous referral traffic. </span></p>\n<figure class=\"post__image\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/4HCXr-QG3213ko9g6RkGap8KZiuSWeAmolfxeDYRjEXnk4iFzvyW1GlKM8FmodSo4-LwbQvcmHJEJVqjfBaQ5LC2pugQNTAGE8sXrVHqJgRgx2o24GtlcYepXI6eC7Fk2OuIFQZuNCz6lpvL-AfATu4\" data-is-external-image=\"true\"  alt=\"Our most successful engineering as marketing game, Coding Font\"><figcaption>Our most successful engineering as marketing game, Coding Font</figcaption></figure>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Long-Term Growth: </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">SEO/Organic Traffic via Long-Tail Keywords </span></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">SEO gets a bad rep from email spam by link-building agencies, but it's one of the best ways to </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">gain free traffic and attract potential users to your site. The most important thing about SEO: it takes time to develop and grow. Once we validated ideas for Typogram, we started paying closer attention to SEO and how we can leverage SEO to increase organic traffic. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You can target long tail keywords, which are three to five words long search queries. Long tails are usually more niche, less search volume, and less competitive. For example, we have the </span><a href=\"https://typogram.co/font-discovery\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">FontDiscovery(our design newsletter) archive</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> for Typogram for our long tail search queries. These posts give us a nice traffic boost, over 1k per month. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I highly recommend Ahrefs' YouTube lessons. Please force yourself to watch them.

Here is what we've working on this month!</p>\n<h2 class=\"header-with-anchor-widget\"><strong>Modularizing Brand Personality</strong></h2>\n<p>During our <a href=\"https://typogram.co/blog/typogram-product-updates-no12-in-app-tutorial-videos-streamlined-brand-name-change-modularized-app-components/\" title=\"typogram product update\">last product update</a>, we shared about our new product thinking: modular steps and shareable work-in-progress. We are making Typogram more modular, making workflow between steps more flexible, and design work more shareable. </p>\n<p>In the last few weeks, we have been working on modularizing the Brand Personality Step. I’ve been (Wenting) making two big changes to Typogram, starting with the brand personality step. </p>\n<h3 class=\"header-with-anchor-widget\"><strong>Changing the Base</strong></h3>\n<p>I initially built Typogram using a javascript framework called Vue. To improve the user experience, I changed the base of Typogram to Svelte. Svelte pre-renders our app and eliminates the need for loading additional JavaScript files, which our previous framework, Vue, lacked. This change will help our app run faster, improving the overall experience!</p>\n<h3 class=\"header-with-anchor-widget\"><strong>Making Parts &amp; Adding Share</strong></h3>\n<p>I’ve also been “modularizing” our app, splitting the app into smaller parts. Modularizing Typogram allows the potential for less linear workflows for users (a popular request ), makes things neater and easier to manage, and makes it possible to reuse the parts to create mini standalone apps for steps like Brand Personality. </p>\n<p>Here is a sneak peek of what I’ve added to the Brand Personality step – sharable social (Instagram) post that you can create and customize to share and test drive your designs immediately with your audience.</p>\n<div class=\"captioned-image-container\">\n<figure>\n<div class=\"image2-inset\"><picture><source type=\"image/webp\" srcset=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_lossy/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1a874421-2a25-44ad-aef5-0cd6431a6df8_538x593.gif 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_lossy/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1a874421-2a25-44ad-aef5-0cd6431a6df8_538x593.gif 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_lossy/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1a874421-2a25-44ad-aef5-0cd6431a6df8_538x593.gif 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_lossy/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1a874421-2a25-44ad-aef5-0cd6431a6df8_538x593.gif 1456w\" sizes=\"100vw\"></picture>\n<figure class=\"sizing-normal\" ><figure class=\"post__image\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  title=\"image: The sharable graphics can be customized with different color themes\" src=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_lossy/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1a874421-2a25-44ad-aef5-0cd6431a6df8_538x593.gif\" data-is-external-image=\"true\"  sizes=\"100vw\" srcset=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_lossy/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1a874421-2a25-44ad-aef5-0cd6431a6df8_538x593.gif 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_lossy/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1a874421-2a25-44ad-aef5-0cd6431a6df8_538x593.gif 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_lossy/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1a874421-2a25-44ad-aef5-0cd6431a6df8_538x593.gif 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_lossy/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1a874421-2a25-44ad-aef5-0cd6431a6df8_538x593.gif 1456w\" alt=\"image: The sharable graphics can be customized with different color themes\" width=\"930\" height=\"1037\" loading=\"lazy\" data-attrs=\"{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/1a874421-2a25-44ad-aef5-0cd6431a6df8_538x593.gif&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:593,&quot;width&quot;:538,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:&quot;image: The sharable graphics can be customized with different color themes&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null}\"></figure>\n<figcaption >image: The sharable graphics can be customized with different color themes</figcaption>\n</figure>\n</div>\n</figure>\n</div>\n<p>You can customize the colors of the post as well as the styles.

A brand is a person’s feeling about a product, a service, or a company. A brand personality is a “personality” or human characteristics we can assign to a brand. You can influence how people feel about your brand by creating a brand personality and then communicating the brand personality visually through the brand’s design directions, like fonts, logos, typography, colors, and imagery.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It can be overwhelming to start figuring out your brand personality, especially if you have no marketing background or have never thought about branding that way. Therefore, we created a fun, interactive workshop kit to help you identify your brand personality. </span></p>\n<figure class=\"post__image\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://typogram.co/blog/media/posts/50/brandPersonality.png\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" srcset=\"https://typogram.co/blog/media/posts/50/responsive/brandPersonality-xs.png 300w ,https://typogram.co/blog/media/posts/50/responsive/brandPersonality-sm.png 480w ,https://typogram.co/blog/media/posts/50/responsive/brandPersonality-md.png 768w ,https://typogram.co/blog/media/posts/50/responsive/brandPersonality-lg.png 1024w\"  alt=\"what is a brand \" width=\"1600\" height=\"900\"></figure>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What is inside our Brand Personality Workshop Kit?  </span></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This kit contains: </span></p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Explanation worksheets with interactive exercises help you understand and identify brand personality</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Custom brand personality cards with visual examples </span></li>\n</ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">By completing the three-step exercise in our workshop kit, you will learn, eliminate and finalize a chosen five top brand personalities, serving as visual directions and inspirations for your brand. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This workshop kit can accommodate a solopreneur or a small team of founders.

As for file formats, the workshop is available in Google Slides, Notion, and PDF, so you may elect to complete this digitally or print it out on paper to get more hands-on. </span></p>\n<figure class=\"post__image\" ><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://typogram.co/blog/media/posts/50/brandPersonalityWorkshopPDF.gif\" alt=\"our brand personality workshop kit in PDF format  \" width=\"1200\" height=\"900\">\n<figcaption >our brand personality workshop kit in PDF format  </figcaption>\n</figure>\n<figure class=\"post__image\" ><img loading=\"lazy\" style=\"color: var(--text-primary-color); font-family: var(--editor-font-family); font-size: inherit; font-weight: var(--font-weight-normal);\" src=\"https://typogram.co/blog/media/posts/50/slider-digital-pic1-2x.png\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" srcset=\"https://typogram.co/blog/media/posts/50/responsive/slider-digital-pic1-2x-xs.png 300w ,https://typogram.co/blog/media/posts/50/responsive/slider-digital-pic1-2x-sm.png 480w ,https://typogram.co/blog/media/posts/50/responsive/slider-digital-pic1-2x-md.png 768w ,https://typogram.co/blog/media/posts/50/responsive/slider-digital-pic1-2x-lg.png 1024w\"  alt=\"our brand personality workshop kit inside Google slides\" width=\"1440\" height=\"1500\">\n<figcaption >our brand personality workshop kit inside Google slides</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<hr>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">How did we develop this kit? </span></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Our brand personality workshop kit originated and evolved from Typogram’s product development process. Initially, we wanted to identify a user experience flow for the brand personality feature inside the Typogram app: how can we make the brand personality a valuable feature to the users? What specific interactions can we include at this step, and what do they look like? </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With many hypotheses, we focused on shipping quickly for testing. We created this workshop using three popular No-Code tools easily accessible to our potential users: PDF, Google Slides, and Notion. Now that we have sped up the product development process using No-Code, we can focus on testing and making the UX as rewarding as possible. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The end product featured a main flow: users sort through different cards of brand personality and each time, they sort and choose using various methods: First, they identify based on a list of words and then narrow down based on images. Ultimately, users land on five words as visual themes/directions for their logos. Observing from our user testing session that branding is a starting point for conversation - we designed the workshop to work for solopreneurs or a team. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We organized user testing sessions and received great feedback. The success of user testing validated the flow and design of our brand personality feature inside Typogram! Because of the overwhelmingly positive response, we now make this kit a free resource for our community. </span></p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Access our Brand Personality Workshop Kit</span></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You can download our free </span><a href=\"https://workshop.typogram.co/\" title=\"Typogram's Brand Personality Workshop Kit\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Brand Personality Workshop Kit</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> on our website.

We have added short in-app tutorial videos that help you along the way in Brand Personality, Brand Color, Distinctive Logo (Logo Editor), and Kerning steps. Each video showcases the available features in that particular step. The short videos present you with how-tos, instructions, and tooltips so that you can find our helpful features. You can find the videos embedded in the learning material posts. We hope you find them useful, and please let us know if you have any feedback.</span></p>\n<figure class=\"post__image\" ><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://typogram.co/blog/media/posts/49/logoEditorVideoScreenshotUpdate.png\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" srcset=\"https://typogram.co/blog/media/posts/49/responsive/logoEditorVideoScreenshotUpdate-xs.png 300w ,https://typogram.co/blog/media/posts/49/responsive/logoEditorVideoScreenshotUpdate-sm.png 480w ,https://typogram.co/blog/media/posts/49/responsive/logoEditorVideoScreenshotUpdate-md.png 768w ,https://typogram.co/blog/media/posts/49/responsive/logoEditorVideoScreenshotUpdate-lg.png 1024w\"  alt=\"img: in-app video inside learning material\" width=\"786\" height=\"536\">\n<figcaption ><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">img: in-app video inside learning material</span></figcaption>\n</figure>\n<figure class=\"post__image\" ><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://typogram.co/blog/media/posts/49/logoEditorVideoUpdate-optimize.gif\" alt=\"img: in-app video showing tips on product features\" width=\"909\" height=\"703\">\n<figcaption ><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">img: in-app video showing tips on product features</span></figcaption>\n</figure>\n<h1> </h1>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Streamlined Brand Name Change </span></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Another popular request we receive is brand name change. Because Typogram offers a one-brand lifetime license, you are locked down to a brand name once you purchase a paid license. However, we understand that sometimes, accidents happen. There can be spelling errors or incorrect name entries.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The old process for the brand name change was manually sending us an email or via the chat widget. Starting today, we have a better, more streamlined process: you can initiate a name change directly in the app through your project dashboard. Under the appropriate project, click “Request Change Brand Name,” to enter a new name for approval. It’ll usually approve within 24 hours.</span></p>\n<figure class=\"post__image\" ><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://typogram.co/blog/media/posts/49/brandNameChangeEditUpdate_2-2.gif\" alt=\"img: request to change brand name\" width=\"1440\" height=\"900\">\n<figcaption ><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">img: Request to change brand name</span></figcaption>\n</figure>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Upcoming: Modularized App Components &amp; Expanding Brand Personality Workshop</span></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We are currently reworking our app from the ground up with a brand-new direction to product thinking: </span><strong>modular steps and shareable work-in-progress.</strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> We take pride in our unique eight-step process for creating a professional brand, but its implementation in the app seems rigid regarding workflow adherence. You must go through a series of steps to reach the final destination—Brand Guidelines—which is the only place and time where you can share your work.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The new Typogram maintains the same brand design philosophies and workflows but is much more modular and flexible. We broke ground on this new app direction with Typogram’s first step—Brand Personality. Once completed, it will function as a modular component that can either stand alone as a mini app or serve as a segue to the full Typogram experience. The Brand Personality app will also feature a more visually stunning presentation you can save and publish. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Our plans for the future: every single step is a standalone app, much more robust, but at the same time, it is still part of the full Typogram experience. The brand design journey can start anywhere and in any order. The work product of each step is presented in a much more visually-impressive way, and you can save and share with your team or community to get feedback.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Let us know what you think of this future direction!</span></p>\n<h1> </h1>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Hearing from You</span></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We’d love to hear more of your thoughts if you have already tried the software.

It is evident that each hue, including those beyond the colors we covered today, carries a unique message, tone, and emotion. Typogram offers an interactive experience for you to delve deeper into the brand psychology behind each hue value from 0° to 360°! </p>\n<p>As you continue to encounter these colors in branding, remember their deeper meanings and the sense of inclusion they represent. Happy Pride Month!</p>\n<div class=\"captioned-image-container\">\n<figure>\n<div class=\"image2-inset post__image--wide\"><figure class=\"post__image\"><source type=\"image/webp\" srcset=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9dd91923-0529-4455-a231-c61160cdb12e_882x562.gif 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9dd91923-0529-4455-a231-c61160cdb12e_882x562.gif 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9dd91923-0529-4455-a231-c61160cdb12e_882x562.gif 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9dd91923-0529-4455-a231-c61160cdb12e_882x562.gif 1456w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://typogram.co/blog/media/posts/45/9dd91923-0529-4455-a231-c61160cdb12e_882x562.gif\" sizes=\"100vw\" srcset=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9dd91923-0529-4455-a231-c61160cdb12e_882x562.gif 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9dd91923-0529-4455-a231-c61160cdb12e_882x562.gif 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9dd91923-0529-4455-a231-c61160cdb12e_882x562.gif 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9dd91923-0529-4455-a231-c61160cdb12e_882x562.gif 1456w\" alt=\"view color tips\" width=\"882\" height=\"562\" loading=\"lazy\" data-attrs=\"{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/9dd91923-0529-4455-a231-c61160cdb12e_882x562.gif&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:562,&quot;width&quot;:882,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:739171,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/gif&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null}\"></figure></picture></div>\n<figcaption class=\"image-caption\">View Color Tips</figcaption>\n</figure>\n</div>\n<p> </p>\n<div class=\"subscription-widget-wrap\">\n<div class=\"subscription-widget show-subscribe\">\n<div class=\"preamble\"> </div>\n</div>\n</div>",
